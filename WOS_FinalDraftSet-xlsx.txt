      "Abstract Note" : "Superconducting test coils impregnated with epoxy composites containing cubic boron nitride (cBN) particles, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) particles, and a mixture of cBN/hBN particles were fabricated, and their thermal and electrical properties were investigated using cool-down, over-current, and repetitive-cooling tests. Micro-voids, which may act as major obstacles to the formation of thermally conductive passages, were observed in the epoxy composites containing the cBN or hBN particle fillers alone but were absent in that containing the cBN/hBN particle mixture. The coil impregnated with epoxy containing the cBN/hBN particle mixture also exhibited superior cooling performance and thermal/electrical stabilities, indicating that this composite effectively facilitated heat transfer between the coil and liquid nitrogen. Moreover, the addition of the cBN/hBN filler reduced the difference in thermal contraction between the superconducting tape and epoxy composite. Overall, the use of the epoxy composite containing the cBN/hBN filler shows potential for the development of highly stable superconducting coils with considerably enhanced thermal conductivity and low coefficients of thermal expansion.

      "Abstract Note" : "Fisher and Carpenter (2013) [12] found a remarkable equivalence of general diagonal norm high-order summation-by-parts operators to a subcell based high-order finite volume formulation. This equivalence enables the construction of provably entropy stable schemes by a specific choice of the subcell finite volume flux. We show that besides the construction of entropy stable high-order schemes, a careful choice of subcell finite volume fluxes generates split formulations of quadratic or cubic terms. Thus, by changing the subcell finite volume flux to a specific choice, we are able to generate, in a systematic way, all common split forms of the compressible Euler advection terms, such as the Ducros splitting and the Kennedy and Gruber splitting. Although these split forms are not entropy stable, we present a systematic way to prove which of those split forms are at least kinetic energy preserving. With this, we construct a unified high-order split form DG framework. We investigate with three dimensional numerical simulations of the inviscid Taylor-Green vortex and show that the new split forms enhance the robustness of high-order simulations in comparison to the standard scheme when solving turbulent vortex dominated flows. In fact, we show that for certain test cases, the novel split form discontinuous Galerkin schemes are more robust than the discontinuous Galerkin scheme with over-integration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "Microfiltration and ultrafiltration are methods of removing colloidal impurities from water and wastewater. One of the major issues when dealing with the practical implementation of membranes is the reduction of water productivity as the foulants accumulate on the membrane surface or within the pores. Membrane regeneration by periodic backwashing is an effective method of reducing fouling; however, to date the timing and duration of the backwashing for effective fouling control is largely only empirically determined. In this manuscript, we present an optimal control formulation to determine the timing and duration for membrane regeneration by backwashing. In this formulation, we use the direction of the flow as the control variable and make predictions regarding the optimal protocol. We explicitly include irreversible attachment due to bacterial deposition and biofilm formation on the membrane and demonstrate that irreversible attachment of bacteria has important ramifications for the effective timing of hydraulic backwashes as well as the efficiency in producing clean water. In particular, we find that irreversible attachment and additional fouling due to exo-polymeric substance (EPS) production and biofilm formation decreases the maximum filtration volume. Additionally, as the effectiveness of membrane regeneration declines, the timing of the cycling is also altered. In general, including the role of EPS in biofouling substantially changes predictions of backwashing timing and implies important considerations for practical predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "A multiplex lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) is developed for the simultaneous on-site determination of three mycotoxins (aflatoxin B-1, zearalenone and ochratoxin A) in corn, rice and peanut. By systematically optimizing the preparation of antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates, the size of gold nanoparticle and the position of capture antigen, the developed LFA can obtain a visual detection limit of 10 mu g/kg for aflatoxin B1, 50 mu g/kg for zearalenone and 15 mu g/kg for ochratoxin A. For quantitative analysis, the limits of detection were 0.10-0.13 mu g/kg for aflatoxin B1, 0.42-0.46 mu g/kg for zearalenone, and 0.19-0.24 mu g/kg for ochratoxin A, which were far below the regulatory limits set by the European Commission. At the spiked concentrations of 0.5-10.0 mu g/kg, the mean recoveries of the three mycotoxins ranged from 86.2 to 114.5% with coefficients of variation less than 16.7%. These results demonstrated that the developed immunoassay can be used for routine monitoring of mycotoxin contamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A temperature versus cerium content (T-x) phase diagram has been constructed from the electrical transport measurements, yielding a superconducting region similar to that found for other electron-doped superconductors. Thermopower measurements show a dramatic change from the underdoped region (x < 0.15) to the overdoped region (x > 0.15). Application of the Fisher-Fisher-Huse (FFH) vortex glass scaling model to the magnetoresistance data was found to be insufficient to describe the data in the region of the vortex-solid to vortex-liquid transition. It was found instead that the modified vortex glass scaling model of Rydh, Rapp, and Anderson provided a good description of the data, indicating the importance of the applied field on the pinning landscape. A magnetic field versus temperature (H-T) phase diagram has also been constructed for the films with x >= 0.14, displaying the evolution of the vortex glass melting lines H-g(T) across the superconducting regime.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral innervation and prostaglandin levels contribute to endometriosis-associated pain. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 16) were surgically instrumented by transplanting uterine tissue onto mesenteric arteries within the peritoneal cavity to create a model of endometriosis which forms extra-uterine endometrial cysts and vaginal hyperalgesia. Our results describe a significant positive correlation between endometriosis-induced vaginal hyperalgesia and cyst innervation density (sensory, r = 0.70, p = 0.003; sympathetic, r = 0.55, p = 0.03), vaginal canal sympathetic innervation density (r = 0.80, p = 0.003), and peritoneal fluid levels of the prostaglandins PGE2 (r = 0.65, p = 0.01) and PGF2 alpha (r = 0.63, p = 0.02). These results support the involvement of cyst innervation and prostaglandins in endometriosis-associated pain. We also describe how sympathetic innervation density of the vaginal canal is an important predictor of vaginal hyperalgesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Using a measure of the suitability of land for growing wheat relative to sugarcane as an instrument for the rule of law, as measured by area 2 of the Economic Freedom of the World index, we estimate the potential causal impact of the rule of law on the long-run net income inequality. Conditioning on geography, ethnolinguistic fractionalization and legal tradition, the rule of law exerts a negative impact on inequality that is both economically and statistically significant. The results are robust to additional control variables, two alternative measures of the rule of law, an alternative instrumental variable and the exclusion of strategic country samples and outliers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To assess whether joblessness affects the commission of serious property crime. We studied serious property crime, applying a case-control design to nationally representative samples of (a) known serious property crime offenders and (b) nonoffenders. This was done by comparing a national sample of prison inmates convicted of robbery or burglary (the \"cases\") with a general sample of the U.S. adult population (the \"controls\"). In contrast to prior individual-level research, the study sample included substantial numbers of serious offenders, and provided a formal basis for generalizing the findings to the U.S. adult population. We differentiated five labor force statuses: (1) unemployed (according to the official government definition), (2) underemployed, (3) out of the labor force for widely socially accepted reasons (OLFL), (4) out of the labor force for reasons not widely accepted (OLFN), and (5) fully employed. We found that when these distinctions are made, people are not more likely to engage in burglary or robbery when they are either completely unemployed or underemployed according to the official definitions. Instead, it is being out of the labor force for reasons not widely accepted as legitimate that is significantly and positively related to serious property offending. The results suggest that offending among jobless persons may reflect preexisting differences in criminal propensity among those who stay out of the labor force, rather than effects of joblessness per se. Part-time work is associated with significantly less property crime, perhaps because the willingness to accept even part-time jobs serves as an indicator of commitment to pro-social attitudes.",

We turn to the work of Roberto Esposito and Jean-Luc Nancy to better make sense of how, during this immunological crisis, the individualized fleshy and fluid body is articulated to dimensions of community and corporeal proximity; the body is thus conceived in popular biopolitical framings as a site of transmission, inoculation, and isolation - as a living ecological and pathological vessel. We give emphasis to the spatial relations of flesh, namely in how biomedical experts' have sought to (bio-)technologize spaces of heightened communal bodily contact (such as playgrounds or gymnasia).",

      "Abstract Note" : "Prior research has shown that difficulties in emotion regulation is associated with overall levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, it is currently unclear which facets of difficulties in emotion regulation (e.g., lack of emotion regulation strategies, impulse control problems, non-acceptance of emotional responses) are associated with specific PTSS clusters. This information may be valuable in refining treatment approaches in PTSS. The aim of the current study was to use structural equation modeling to test the relationships between Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) subfactors and PTSS in a trauma-exposed community sample (N = 746). Results indicated that impulse control difficulties were most consistently associated across PTSS clusters (i.e., re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal), while lack of emotion regulation strategies and emotional clarity were uniquely associated with numbing symptoms, after covarying for neuroticism. However, other facets of difficulties in emotion regulation (i.e., non-acceptance of emotional responses and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior while upset) were not associated with PTSS. These findings provide further support for the role of difficulties in emotion regulation in specific PTSS clusters. Additionally, they suggest that impulse control problems may be important in the development of most PTSS and thus most beneficial to target clinically, while lack of emotional clarity and effective emotion regulation strategies may be specific to numbing symptoms.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although the traditional CVaR-based portfolio methods are successfully used in practice, the size of a portfolio with thousands of assets makes optimizing them difficult, if not impossible to solve. In this article we introduce a large CVaR-based portfolio selection method by imposing weight constraints on the standard CVaR-based portfolio selection model, which effectively avoids extreme positions often emerging in traditional methods. We propose to solve the large CVaR-based portfolio model with weight constraints using penalized quantile regression techniques, which overcomes the difficulties of large scale optimization in traditional methods. We illustrate the method via empirical analysis of optimal portfolios on Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 (HS300) index and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSEC) index of China. The empirical results show that our method is efficient to solve a large portfolio selection and performs well in dispersing tail risk of a portfolio by only using a small amount of financial assets.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Distress intolerance (DI) is conceptualized as an individual difference reflective of the ability to tolerate aversive psychological states. Although high DI has demonstrated cross-sectional associations with multiple forms of psychopathology, few studies have tested key facets of its theoretical conceptualization. Specifically, little research has been conducted on DI's theorized role as an incrementally valid prospective moderator of the relationship between daily stressful events and affective symptoms reflective of preoccupation with aversive internal (e.g., depression, worry) rather than external stimuli (e.g., social anxiety). Method: A non-clinical sample (N = 147; 77% female; M age = 19.32) in which high DI individuals were oversampled was recruited. Participants completed baseline measures of DI and trait negative affect followed by six diary entries over a two-week period in which participants reported on daily stressors, negative affect, worry, depressive, and social anxiety symptoms. Results: Hierarchical linear models revealed that DI positively predicted depressive and worry, but not social anxiety symptoms, independent of daily stressors and negative affect. Further, a significant interaction effect was found such that the positive association between daily stressor(s) occurrence and daily worry was significant at high, but not low DI, and a similar trend-level interaction effect was observed for depressive symptoms. The interaction for social anxiety symptoms was non-significant Limitations: Utilization of a non-clinical sample precludes generalization of results to clinical samples. Only self-reported DI was assessed, limiting conclusions to perceived as opposed to behaviorally-indexed DI. Conclusions: Results largely supported Dl's theoretical conceptualization as an incrementally valid moderator of stress responding with relevance to particular affective symptoms.

      "Abstract Note" : "Recently, two-dimensional materials and in particular transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied because of their strong light-matter interaction and the remarkable optoelectronic response of their field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we report a photoconductivity study from FETs built from few-layers of p-WSe2 measured in a multi-terminal configuration under illumination by a 532 nm laser source. The photogenerated current was measured as a function of the incident optical power, of the drain-to-source bias and of the gate voltage. We observe a considerably larger photoconductivity when the phototransistors were measured via a four-terminal configuration when compared to a two-terminal one. For an incident laser power of 248 nW, we extract 18 A W-1 and similar to 4000% for the two-terminal responsivity (R) and the concomitant external quantum efficiency (EQE) respectively, when a bias voltage V-ds = 1 V and a gate voltage V-bg = 10 V are applied to the sample. R and EQE are observed to increase by 370% to similar to 85 A W-1 and similar to 20 000% respectively, when using a four-terminal configuration. Thus, we conclude that previous reports have severely underestimated the optoelectronic response of transition metal dichalcogenides, which in fact reveals a remarkable potential for photosensing applications.",

However, parental conflict and divorce, both separately and the interaction between the two, have not often been studied in premarital relationships, especially when considering possible mechanisms mediating these effects. In a large sample of emerging adults (N = 353), we show that when the most plausible mediating mechanisms are simultaneously considered, only relational commitment mediates the influence of parental conflict on outcomes. Parental conflict in the absence of divorce was associated with less commitment and, in turn, less relationship satisfaction and stability in emerging adult children's romantic relationships, whereas parental conflict was unrelated to outcomes for children whose parents divorced. Implications for theory and preventive interventions are discussed.",

Baseline levels of PSS and stress were obtained. Health status was assessed at baseline and follow-up. Results: Analyses revealed a positive effect of PSS on health functioning. There was a three-way interaction among race, stress, and PSS on health functioning. Probing the interaction, for Caucasians, PSS was beneficial at low stress, but not high stress. For African Americans, PSS had a positive effect regardless of stress level. Discussion: PSS is an important protective factor for preserving positive health in late-life; however, benefits may differ by race and intensity of stressor.",

A novel third-order Adams-Moulton scheme is used for the discretization of the dissipative term whereas a third-order explicit Adams-Bashforth scheme is used for the time discretization of the interface term that couples the Stokes and Darcy components. The scheme is efficient in the sense that one needs to solve, at each time step, decoupled Stokes and Darcy problems. Therefore, legacy Stokes and Darcy solvers can be applied in parallel. The scheme is also unconditionally stable and, with a mild time-step restriction, long-time accurate in the sense that the error is bounded uniformly in time. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the theoretical results. To the authors' knowledge, the novel algorithm is the first third-order accurate numerical scheme for the Stokes-Darcy system possessing its favorable efficiency, stability, and accuracy properties.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A class of exact multi-component constant intensity solutions to a vector nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) system in the presence of an external PT-symmetric complex potential is constructed. This type of uniform wave pattern displays a non-trivial phase whose spatial dependence is induced by the lattice structure. In this regard, light can propagate without scattering while retaining its original form despite the presence of inhomogeneous gain and loss. These constant-intensity continuous waves are then used to perform a modulational instability analysis in the presence of both non-hermitian media and cubic nonlinearity. A linear stability eigenvalue problem is formulated that governs the dynamical evolution of the periodic perturbation and its spectrum is numerically determined using Fourier-Floquet-Bloch theory. In the self-focusing case, we identify an intensity threshold above which the constant-intensity modes are modulationally unstable for any Floquet-Bloch momentum belonging to the first Brillouin zone. The picture in the self-defocusing case is different. Contrary to the bulk vector case, where instability develops only when the waves are strongly coupled, here an instability occurs in the strong and weak coupling regimes. The linear stability results are supplemented with direct (nonlinear) numerical simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The purpose of this study was to explore domain-general cognitive skills, domain-specific academic skills, and demographic characteristics that are associated with calculation development from first grade to third grade among young children with learning difficulties. Participants were 176 children identified with reading and mathematics difficulties at the beginning of first grade. Data were collected on working memory, language, nonverbal reasoning, processing speed, decoding, numerical competence, incoming calculations, socioeconomic status, and gender at the beginning of first grade and on calculation performance at four time points: the beginning of first grade, the end of first grade, the end of second grade, and the end of third grade. Latent growth modeling analysis showed that numerical competence, incoming calculation, processing speed, and decoding skills significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the beginning of first grade. Numerical competence and processing speed significantly explained the variance in calculation performance at the end of third grade. However, numerical competence was the only significant predictor of calculation development from the beginning of first grade to the end of third grade. Implications of these findings for early calculation instructions among young at-risk children are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This work discusses a closed-loop control strategy for complex systems utilizing scarce and streaming data. A discrete embedding space is first built using hash functions applied to the sensor measurements from which a Markov process model is derived, approximating the complex system's dynamics. A control strategy is then learned using reinforcement learning once rewards relevant with respect to the control objective are identified. This method is designed for experimental configurations, requiring no computations nor prior knowledge of the system, and enjoys intrinsic robustness. It is illustrated on two systems: the control of the transitions of a Lorenz'63 dynamical system, and the control of the drag of a cylinder flow. The method is shown to perform well.",

We re-examine this issue using a panel threshold regression approach, which allows the effect of earnings management on the CEO compensation to change across the level of earnings management and CEO compensation. Our results show that the effect of CEOs' discretionary accounting choices on their compensation is not homogeneous across various degrees of earnings management and compensation. In particular, for firms with moderate (inordinate) levels of earnings management and CEO compensation, earnings management is rewarded (penalized).",

Using national data, the present study examined the contributions of religious involvement and social support to self-rated mental health (SRMH) of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Filipinos. Findings demonstrated cross-group variations, with Filipinos reporting the highest levels of SRMH, acculturation, and discrimination. However, religious involvement was associated with better SRMH in the least religious Chinese subgroup but not in the most religious Filipino subgroup. Social support predicted SRMH for both Chinese and Vietnamese subgroups. The differential religious patterns in the more acculturated generations between the two AA subgroups suggest religious assimilation as part of their acculturation in the context of divergent immigration experiences.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Introduction: Pre-treatment attrition and perceived barriers for quitting are clinically important processes involved in early phases of quitting smoking. However, less is known about the constructs that may contribute to these processes such as negative affect reduction smoking motives. Method: The current study sought to evaluate the relation between negative affect reduction smoking motives and pre-treatment attrition and perceived barriers for quitting in a sample of 425 treatment-seeking smokers (48.5% female; M-age = 37.69 years; SD = 13.61) enrolled in a smoking cessation study examining the efficacy of a transdiagnostic panic-smoking cessation treatment relative to a standard smoking cessation treatment. Results: Results indicated that greater negative affect reduction smoking motives was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment initiation (odds ratio = 1.49, CI: 1.09, 2.04). Additionally, negative affect reduction smoking motives was associated with greater perceived barriers for cessation among pre-treatment drop-outs and treatment initiators. Conclusions: This initial investigation provides evidence for the possible clinical utility in addressing negative affect reduction smoking motives during early stages of quitting. Additionally, such findings could potentially inform the development of personalized, early stages of quitting interventions for smoking cessation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A convenient sampling technique was used to select the sample. A total of 271 questionnaires distributed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia were used for data analysis. The result from the structural analysis suggests that physical environment in an international airport influences passengers' delight and satisfaction. Moreover, national identity portrayed in airport moderates the relationships between physical environment, passengers' delight and satisfaction. Overall, findings of this study extends the understanding of physical environment, passengers' delight and satisfaction and national identity in the context of an international airport and offer implications for international airport authorities.

      "Abstract Note" : "Various experimental measurements were performed to complete the phase diagram of a weakly distorted triangular lattice system, Sr3NiNb2O9 with Ni2+, spin-1 magnetic ions. This compound possesses an isosceles triangular lattice with two shorter bonds and one longer bond. It shows a two-step magnetic phase transition at T-N1 similar to 5.1 K and T-N2 similar to 5.5 K at zero magnetic field, characteristic of an easy-axis anisotropy. In the magnetization curves, a series of magnetic phase transitions was observed such as an up-up-down phase at mu H-0(c1) similar to 10.5 T with 1/3 of the saturation magnetization (M-sat) and an oblique phase at mu H-0(c2) similar to 16 T with root 3/3 M-sat. Intriguingly, the magnetic phase transition below T-N2 is in tandem with the ferroelectricity, which demonstrates multiferroic behaviors. Moreover, the multiferroic phase persists in all magnetically ordered phases regardless of the spin structure. The comparison between the phase diagrams of Sr3NiNb2O9 and its sister compound with an equilateral triangular lattice antiferromagnet Ba3NiNb2O9 (Hwang et al 2012 Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 257205), illustrates how a small imbalance among exchange interactions change the magnetic ground states of the TLAFs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a unique contrast based on the restricted directionality of water movement in an anisotropic environment. As such, DTI-based tractography can be used to characterize and quantify the structural connectivity within neural tissue. Here, DTI-based connectivity within isolated abdominal ganglia of Aplysia californica (ABG) is analyzed using network theory. In addition to quantifying the regional physical proprieties of the fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient, DTI tractography was used to probe inner-connections of local communities, yielding unweighted, undirected graphs that represent community structures. Local and global efficiency, characteristic path lengths and clustering analysis are performed on both experimental and simulated data. The relevant intensity by which these specific nodes communicate is probed through weighted clustering coefficient measurements. Both small-worldness and novel small-world metrics were used as tools to verify the small-world properties for the experimental results. The aim of this manuscript is to categorize the properties exhibited by structural networks in a model neural tissue to derive unique mean field information that quantitatively describe macroscopic connectivity. For ABG, findings demonstrate a default structural network with preferential specific small-world properties when compared to simulated lattice and random networks that are equivalent in order and degree.

      "Abstract Note" : "This work evaluated the interaction of perchlorate and trichloroethene (TCE), two common co-contaminants in groundwater, during bioreduction in serum bottles containing synthetic mineral salts media and microbial consortia. TCE at concentrations up to 0.3 mM did not significantly affect perchlorate reduction; however, perchlorate concentrations higher than 0.1 mM made the reduction of TCE significantly slower. Perchlorate primarily inhibited the reduction of vinyl chloride (VC, a daughter product of TCE) to ethene. Mechanistic analysis showed that the inhibition was mainly because perchlorate reduction is thermodynamically more favorable than reduction of TCE and its daughter products and not because of toxicity due to accumulation of dissolved oxygen produced during perchlorate reduction. As the initial perchlorate concentration increased from 0 to 600 mg/L in a set of serum bottles, the relative abundance of Rhodocyclaceae (a putatively perchlorate-reducing genus) increased from 6.3 to 80.6%, while the relative abundance of Dehalococcoides, the only known genus that is able to reduce TCE all the way to ethene, significantly decreased. Similarly, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (a phylum to which most known perchlorate-reducing bacteria belong) increased from 22% to almost 80%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Deconvolution of aeroacoustic data acquired with microphone phased arrays is a computationally challenging task for distributed sources with arbitrary coherence. A new technique for performing such deconvolution is proposed. This technique relies on analysis of the array data in the wavenumber-frequency domain, allowing for fast convolution and reduced storage requirements when compared to traditional coherent deconvolution. A positive semi definite constraint for the iterative deconvolution procedure is implemented and shows improved behavior in terms of quantifiable convergence metrics when compared to a standalone covariance inequality constraint. A series of simulations validates the method's ability to resolve coherence and phase angle relationships between partially coherent sources, as well as determines convergence criteria for deconvolution analysis. Simulations for point sources near the microphone phased array show potential for handling such data in the wavenumber-frequency domain. In particular, a physics-based integration boundary calculation is described, and can successfully isolate sources and track the appropriate integration bounds with and without the presence of flow. Magnitude and phase relationships between multiple sources are successfully extracted. Limitations of the deconvolution technique are determined from the simulations, particularly in the context of a simulated acoustic field in a closed test section wind tunnel with strong boundary layer contamination. A final application to a trailing edge noise experiment conducted in an open-jet wind tunnel matches best estimates of acoustic levels from traditional calculation methods and qualitatively assesses the coherence characteristics of the trailing edge noise source.

To incorporate the motion of the domain, we use an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation to map the governing equations to a fixed reference domain. The approximation is made stable by a discretization of a skew-symmetric formulation of the problem. We prove that the discrete approximation is stable, conservative and, for constant coefficient problems, maintains the free-stream preservation property. We also provide details on how to add the new skew symmetric ALE approximation to an existing discontinuous Galerkin spectral element code.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this article we obtain a simple topological and dynamical systems condition which is necessary and sufficient for an arbitrary pseudo-Anosov flow in a closed, hyperbolic three manifold to be quasigeodesic. Quasigeodesic means that orbits are efficient in measuring length up to a bounded multiplicative distortion when lifted to the universal cover. We prove that such flows are quasigeodesic if and only if there is an upper bound, depending only on the flow, on the number of orbits which are freely homotopic to an arbitrary closed orbit of the flow. The main ingredient is a proof that, under the boundedness condition, the fundamental group of the manifold acts as a uniform convergence group on a flow ideal boundary of the universal cover. We also construct a flow ideal compactffication of the universal cover, and prove that it is equivariantly homeomorphic to the Gromov compactffication. This implies the quasigeodesic behavior of the flow. The flow ideal boundary and flow ideal compactffication are constructed using only the structure of the flow.

The effects of liquid flow rate, liquid conductivity, concentration of dye, and the addition of ferrous ion on dye decoloration and degradation were determined. Higher liquid flow rates and concentrations of dye resulted in less decoloration percentages and hydrogen peroxide formation due to initial liquid conductivity effects and lower residence times in the reactor. The highest decoloration energy yield of dye found in these studies was 5.2 g/kWh when using the higher liquid flow rate and adding the catalyst. The non-homogeneous nature of the plasma discharge favors the production of hydrogen peroxide in the plasma-liquid interface over the chemical oxidation of the organic in the bulk liquid phase and post-plasma reactions with the Fenton catalyst lead to complete utilization of the plasma-formed hydrogen peroxide.

      "Abstract Note" : "Polymer electrolytes are an interesting class of electrolytes that hold promise for safer, flexible, high-energy batteries. Block copolymer electrolytes that contain polystyrene, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide salt (LiTFSI) are compatible with lithium metal. However, the compatibility of PEO-based electrolyte with advanced lithium positive electrodes has not been conclusively demonstrated. Therefore, oxidative stability of PEO+LiTFSI and the block copolymer electrolyte with common current collectors and against inert working electrodes have been investigated electrochemically. The solid nature of these polymer electrolytes is a challenge for electrochemical investigations, since most electrochemical experiments have been designed for liquid electrolyte. In order to quantitatively evaluate polymer electrolyte stability, an electrochemical approach especially designed for solid electrolytes is presented. This approach uses a set of linear sweep voltammograms from different, large overpotentials to open circuit voltage, which the authors term variable reverse linear sweep voltammetry. By allowing the cell to relax between each polarization, the first data points of each voltammogram are not mass transfer limited. This yields current versus overpotential data that can be analyzed with a kinetic model, such as the Butler-Volmer model. The block copolymer electrolyte has been found to be quite stable to electrochemical oxidation, up to 5 V at 40 degrees C. The degradation reaction has been found to be slow with large thermal activation energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Results: The results showed that self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and positive affect accounted for 55.1% of the variance in accommodation request intentions. Conclusions: Accommodation request is a complex process that involves cognitive and affective factors for individuals with disabilities. Rehabilitation professionals need to help PWDs boost their level of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy by engaging in accommodation request and goal-setting skills training. In addition, rehabilitation professionals should assist PWDs to recognize the significance of positive affect in the process of accommodation request.",

Although this slowness with aging may be entirely related to degradation of the cerebral networks important in motor programing, it is possible that, at least in part, it may be a learned procedure for enhancing the accuracy and/or precision of movements. The goal of this study is to test these contradictory hypotheses. Methods: Twenty-four healthy adults, 12 younger than age 26 and 12 older than age 65 were asked to make alternative marks with a pen between a card centered in front of them and a series of circles distributed across a page. Performance was timed, and participants were instructed to complete the task as quickly as possible while not sacrificing accuracy for speed. The circle sizes and hand used varied by trial. Results: The older adults performed the task more slowly for all target circle diameters. As the circles decreased in size, the younger adults performed the task more rapidly than did the older participants, but the younger participants also had a greater decline in accuracy. Conclusions: During this aiming task, healthy older adults were less likely than younger adults to sacrifice accuracy for speed. Thus, at least in part, their slowing may be a learned adaptive strategy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

In this paper, we report on findings from a latent change score analysis of oral reading fluency and reading comprehension data from a longitudinal sample of approximately 16,000 students from first to fourth grade. Results highlight the utility of latent change score models compared to alternative specifications of linear and nonlinear quadratic latent growth models as well as implications for modeling change with correlated traits.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Terrorism is becoming a priority among police agencies in many Western democracies. Scholars argue that increasing homeland security responsibilities can erode police-community relations, in that people perceive the police as neglecting local crime problems for homeland security concerns. Methods: Using Israel as a case study, we evaluate, through path analyses, whether Israeli Jews who perceive that the Israeli National Police (INP) values homeland security more than its crime responsibilities have lower evaluations of police legitimacy and, in turn, are less willing to cooperate with the police. Results: The findings demonstrate that those who believe the INP neglects its crime responsibilities for homeland security view the police as less legitimate, and lower evaluations of police legitimacy decrease willingness to cooperate. The overall indirect effect of perceived neglect on cooperation is not significant. Conclusions: Based on the findings, it is clear that perceptions of what the police ought to be doing influence legitimacy evaluations, even when controlling for key antecedents of legitimacy. The implications of these findings for policing terrorism and legitimacy studies are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Disgust is thought to play a prominent role in multiple anxiety disorders and fears, including spider phobia, though little attention has been given to specific treatment strategies that may be effective for multiple disgust-based fears. Aims: In the present study, we evaluated contamination-focused exposure as a potential transdiagnostic treatment strategy for disgust-based fears in a spider fearful sample. Method: Women with significant spider fear were randomized to three 30-minute sessions of exposure therapy involving repeated contact with a dirt mixture (n=17) or a waitlist control condition (n=17). Assessments of spider fear and disgust were administered at baseline and at one-week posttreatment. Results: At high (but not low) levels of pretreatment disgust propensity, exposure led to lower in vivo spider fear and perceived danger than waitlist, though exposure had no effects on spider-related disgust. Similar effects of exposure on spider fear were found at high levels of pretreatment spider-related disgust. Exposure also reduced fear and danger perceptions, but not disgust, related to a separate contamination assessment (touching a toilet). No effects of treatment were found on self-report measures of spider fear or disgust propensity. Conclusions: These findings suggest contamination-focused exposure therapy may be an effective transdiagnostic treatment strategy for individuals with elevated disgust propensity. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: This study explores the mechanisms of tailoring within the context of RU@Risk a brief Web-based intervention designed to promote sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing among young adults. This is one of a few studies to empirically examine theorized message processing mechanisms of tailoring and persuasion outcomes in a single model. Method: Sexually active college students (N = 1065) completed a pretest, were randomly assigned to explore a tailored or nontailored website, completed a posttest, and were offered the opportunity to order a free at-home STD test kit. As intervention effects were hypothesized to work via increases in perceived risk, change in perceived risk from pretest to posttest by condition was examined. Hypothesized mechanisms of tailoring (perceived personal relevance, attention, and elaboration) were examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). All analyses controlled for demographic variables and sexual history. Results: As predicted, perceived risk of STDs increased from pretest to posttest, but only in the tailored condition. Results revealed that exposure to the tailored (vs. nontailored) website increased perceived personal relevance, attention to, and elaboration of the message. These effects in turn were associated with greater perceived risk of STDs and intentions to get tested. Additionally, participants in the tailored condition were more likely to order a test kit. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into the mechanisms of tailoring with important implications for optimizing message design.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Low self-control has been linked with smoking, yet it remains unclear whether childhood self-control underlies the emergence of lifetime smoking patterns. We examined the contribution of childhood self-control to early smoking initiation and smoking across adulthood. Methods: 21,132 participants were drawn from 2 nationally representative cohort studies; the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS) and the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS). Child self-control was teacher-rated at age 10 in the BCS and at ages 7 and 11 in the NCDS. Participants reported their smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per day at 5 time-points in the BCS (ages 26-42) and 6 time-points in the NCDS (ages 23-55). Both studies controlled for socioeconomic background, cognitive ability, psychological distress, gender, and parental smoking; the NCDS also controlled for an extended set of background characteristics. Results: Early self-control made a substantial graded contribution to (not) smoking throughout life. In adjusted regression models, a 1-SD increase in self-control predicted a 6.9 percentage point lower probability of smoking in the BCS, and this was replicated in the NCDS (5.2 point reduced risk). Adolescent smoking explained over half of the association between self-control and adult smoking. Childhood self-control was positively related to smoking cessation and negatively related to smoking initiation, relapse to smoking, and the number of cigarettes smoked in adulthood. Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that low childhood self-control predicts an increased risk of smoking throughout adulthood and points to adolescent smoking as a key pathway through which this may occur.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The de-pinning or irreversibility lines were determined by ac susceptibility, magnetization, radio-frequency proximity detector oscillator (PDO), and resistivity methods in Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)(2)As-2 ( T (c) = 23.2 K), Ba(Fe0.95Ni0.05)(2)As-2 ( T (c) = 20.4 K), and Ba(Fe0.94Ni0.06)(2)As-2 ( T (c) = 18.5 K) bulk superconductors in ac, dc, and pulsed magnetic fields up to 65 T. A new method of extracting the irreversibility fields from the radio-frequency proximity detector oscillator induction technique is described. Wide temperature broadening of the irreversibility lines, for any given combination of ac and dc fields, is dependent on the time frame of measurement. Increasing the magnetic field sweep rate (dH/dt) shifts the irreversibility lines to higher temperatures up to about dH/d t = 40,000 Oe/s; for higher dH/dt, there is little impact on the irreversibility line. There is an excellent data match between the irreversibility fields obtained from magnetization hysteresis loops, PDO, and ac susceptibility measurements, but not from resistivity measurements in these materials. Lower critical field vs. temperature phase diagrams are measured. Their very low values near 0 T indicate that these materials are in mixed state in nonzero magnetic fields, and yet the strength of the vortex pinning enables very high irreversibility fields, as high as 51 T at 1.5 K for the Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)(2)As-2 polycrystalline sample, showing a promise for liquid helium temperature applications.",

A comprehensive study of the ac magnetic susceptibility and its first ten harmonics finds shifts to higher temperatures with increasing ac measurement frequencies (10 to 10,000 Hz) for a wide range of ac (1, 5, and 10 Oe) and dc fields (0 to 12 T). The characteristic measurement time constant t (1) is extracted from the exponential fit of the data and linked to vortex relaxation. The Anderson-Kim Arrhenius law is applied to determine flux activation energy E (a) /k as a function dc magnetic field. The de-pinning, or irreversibility lines, were determined by a variety of methods and extensively mapped. The ac response shows surprisingly weak higher harmonic components, suggesting weak nonlinear behavior. Our data does not support the Fisher model; we do not see an abrupt vortex glass to vortex liquid transition and the resistivity does not drop to zero, although it appears to approach zero exponentially.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study explored similarities and differences of negative career thoughts in a sample of 1,562 Americans and 3,811 South Koreans by analyzing mean scores, item endorsement rates, and factor structures of the career thoughts inventory (CTI). A comparison of mean scores of the CTI scales showed that Koreans scored significantly higher on all scales than did Americans among high school, college, and adult participants. However, a comparison of ranks of item endorsement rates indicated that they were very similar. A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the original three-factor solution of the normative data was a good fit for the United States across all age-groups but was not for the normative data of the respective age-groups from South Korea. Follow-up exploratory factor analyses identified possible alternative internal structures of the Korean CTI. Implications of the findings regarding plausible cultural influences on negative career thoughts as well as the use of the CTI in career counseling with members of the United States and Korean cultures are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The distribution of electric charge in atomic nuclei is fundamental to our understanding of the complex nuclear dynamics and a quintessential observable to validate nuclear structure models.. The aim of this study is to explore a novel approach that combines sophisticated models of nuclear structure with Bayesian neural networks (BNN) to generate predictions for the charge radii of thousands of nuclei throughout the nuclear chart. A class of relativistic energy density functionals is used to provide robust predictions for nuclear charge radii. In turn, these predictions are refined through Bayesian learning for a neural network that is trained using residuals between theoretical predictions and the experimental data. Although predictions obtained with density functional theory provide a fairly good description of experiment, our results show significant improvement (better than 40%) after BNN refinement. Moreover, these improved results for nuclear charge radii are supplemented with theoretical error bars. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of the BNN approach to significantly increase the accuracy of nuclear models in the predictions of nuclear charge radii. However, as many before us, we failed to uncover the underlying physics behind the intriguing behavior of charge radii along the calcium isotopic chain.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Students with visual impairment (VI) lack access to the same models and reinforcers as students with sight. Consequentially, behaviors that children with sight acquire through observation must be explicitly taught to children with VI. In addition, children with VI have difficulty maintaining such behaviors. Therefore, interventions that promote self-management of students' own behavior are desirable. In this study, three adolescents used self-talk to increase chewing with a closed mouth during mealtimes. We used explicit instruction to teach students the target behavior and to use a small vibrating device as a reminder to self-talk during mealtimes. Prompts were faded as participants increased chewing with a closed mouth. Following mealtimes, performance feedback and reinforcement were provided. All students increased percentage of intervals chewing with a closed mouth immediately at the start of intervention and maintained this behavior for up to 1 month post-intervention. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.",

Although some studies have also examined the relevance of neuropsychological-familial interplay in the prediction of adolescent misconduct, scholars have yet to explore whether this interplay is generalizable across groups stratified by race and socioeconomic status (SES). The current study employs data drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to examine whether race and SES condition the interactive effects of neuropsychological deficits and adverse parenting on adolescent misconduct (N = 7,155). The results reveal that interactions between neuropsychological deficits and adverse parenting during childhood are especially predictive of adolescent misconduct among relatively privileged subsets of the sample (i.e., White, high SES). Limitations are noted, and future avenues for research are discussed.",

Eighty women with no imaging abnormalities (BI-RADS 1 and 2) were included in this institutional review board (IRB)-approved prospective study. All women underwent un-enhanced breast MRI. Four radiologists independently assessed FGT with MRI by subjective visual estimation according to BI-RADS. Automated observer-independent quantitative measurement of FGT with MRI was performed using a previously described measurement system.

Inexperienced readers achieved moderate inter-/intra-observer agreement and experienced readers a substantial inter- and perfect intra-observer agreement for subjective visual estimation of FGT. Practice and experience reduced observer-dependency. Automated observer-independent quantitative measurement of FGT was successfully performed and revealed only fair to moderate agreement (k = 0.209-0.497) with subjective visual estimations of FGT. Subjective visual estimation of FGT with MRI shows moderate intra-/inter-observer agreement, which can be improved by practice and experience.

      "Abstract Note" : "With the increasing utilization of Web-based surveys for suicide and suicide-related research, it is critical to understand factors that affect participants' decision to request study compensation (and thus potentially reveal their identity) or remain anonymous. This study evaluated differences in demographics, suicidal symptoms, and suicide-related constructs between participants electing and declining to provide identifying information to receive study compensation. A sample of 931 firefighters (91.5% male) participated in a Web-based mental health survey; on survey completion, individuals had the option to provide contact information to receive a $10 gift card. Logistic regression analyses were employed to investigate differences between those who did and did not provide this information. Overall, 82.8% provided identifying information, with younger individuals significantly more likely to do so. Participants reporting more severe suicidal symptoms and greater levels of suicide-related constructs appeared equally, and in some cases, significantly more, willing to provide identifying information. Findings indicate that individuals reporting more sensitive or stigmatizing experiences might not systematically opt out of receiving study compensation to remain anonymous on Web-based surveys. Additional research is warranted to replicate these findings in more representative samples and further delineate personality and other factors influencing the disclosure of contact information to receive study compensation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "As the cruise ship industry moves towards ever larger vessels, many tourist destinations are faced with dilemmas about how to accommodate the latest generation of ships, which require deeper and wider shipping pathways. The location of nearshore shipping channels traveled by cruise ships has important environmental and economic implications, as dredging larger lanes damages habitat, ship traffic produces sediment plumes that can smother adjacent sensitive habitats (e.g., coral reefs, seagrass beds), and dredging costs vary spatially. These environmental and economic costs should ideally be evaluated in the context of projected benefits from increased tourism. To inform decision-making on cruise ship pathway design, we evaluated tradeoffs among tourism revenue to the local economy, dredging costs, direct coral damage and sedimentation impacts to coral reefs of alternative cruise ship approach channels for the island of Bermuda. We compiled economic data on cruise tourism and dredging costs and developed a sediment particle tracking model, overlaid on maps of coral cover, to track the spread of sediment particles and resulting coral sedimentation caused by cruise ships. Using our models we compared two viable routes, if dredged, for larger ships to reach Bermuda, along with a scenario of no dredging in which the next generation of larger ships is not accommodated. Our tradeoff analysis shows that the status quo (no dredging; no larger ships) scenario performs relatively well except for the risk of a significant loss in tourism revenue. When selecting between the two channel upgrade scenarios, the south channel upgrade is preferable if dredged material can be reused, thereby recouping dredging costs; otherwise, there is a strong tradeoff between upgrade costs and coral sedimentation. While developed with data layers and inputs specific to Bermuda, this analytical approach could easily be configured to other locations facing similar spatial planning decisions about whether and where to allow pathways for larger cruise ships.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Whereas accounts of skilled performance based on automaticity (Beilock & Carr, 2001; Fitts & Posner, 1967) emphasize reduced cognitive involvement in advanced skill, other accounts propose that skilled performance relies on increased cognitive control (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). The objective of this study was to test predictions differentiating the automaticity and cognitive control accounts by assessing thinking during golf putting. Design: The cognitive processes of less-skilled and more-skilled golfers were examined during putting using concurrent, think-aloud verbal reports. The design included putting conditions that differed in complexity and thus the need to adapt the putt to the particular conditions. Method: Putting complexity was manipulated via changes to putt length and perceived stress during putting. Putts were executed from two starting locations (i.e., the same starting location as the previous putt or a new starting location). Results: The analysis showed that, during putting: more thoughts were verbalized overall by more skilled golfers than less-skilled golfers; both groups verbalized more thoughts overall during higher complexity putts (i.e., longer distance putts, and putts under higher stress when executed from a new starting location) than lower-complexity putts; and the two groups did not differ significantly in the number of thoughts related to motor mechanics. Conclusions: The results of this study provide support for a cognitive control account of skilled performance and suggest that the path to skilled performance involves the acquisition of more refined higher level cognitive representations mediating planning and analysis.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: The aims of this study were twofold: (a) to compare the effects of indoor and outdoor environments on cycling endurance and thought dynamics, (b) to investigate a possible link between cycling endurance and the adherence to task-unrelated thoughts (TUT) in both environments. Design: An experimental, within-subject design with two-trial random assignment was used. Methods: Participants (n = 13) cycled at constant power until volitional exhaustion while imposing TUT. They reported thought changes using self-selected key words that were subsequently classified based on task-relatedness (TUT, and task-related thoughts (TRT)) and direction (internal, external). Mean values of relative time spent in TUT and TRT categories were computed and compared for 5 equal time intervals. The association between cycling endurance and time spent at each thought-related category was analyzed. Results: Analyses revealed a decrease of TUT and an increase of TRT as a function of time (spent cycling) in both environments. Three qualitative thought phases emerged: an initially stable TUT phase was followed by a metastable phase characterized by shifts between TUT and TRT, and a final stable TRT phase appeared nearing exhaustion. Participants cycled longer outdoors than indoors M-outdoors = 12.54 min, SEM = 2.17 s, M-indoors = 11.35 min, SEM = 1.52 s (Z= -2.27, p < 0.05, d(95% CI) = 0.56 (-0.80, 3.07)), with a dominance of external thought categories. Cycling endurance seemed to be facilitated by TUT-E outdoors and TRT-I in both types of environments. Conclusion: Outdoor environment resulted in improved cycling endurance and greater use of external thoughts (i.e., dissociative attentional strategy) relative to indoor environment. The effectiveness of thought categories seemed contingent upon their stability, which in turn depended on effort accumulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A two stage pretreatment approach for biomass is developed in the current work in which dilute acid (DA) pretreatment is followed by a solvent based pretreatment (N-methyl morpholine N oxide - NMMO). When the combined pretreatment (DAWNT) is applied to sugarcane bagasse and corn stover, the rates of hydrolysis and overall yields (>90%) are seen to dramatically improve and under certain conditions 48 h can be taken off the time of hydrolysis with the additional NMMO step to reach similar conversions. DAWNT shows a 2-fold increase in characteristic rates and also fractionates different components of biomass - DA treatment removes the hemicellulose while the remaining cellulose is broken down by enzymatic hydrolysis after NMMO treatment to simple sugars. The remaining residual solid is high purity lignin. Future work will focus on developing a full scale economic analysis of DAWNT for use in biomass fractionation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An energy model is defined which accounts for the elastic bending energy of each vesicle and the contact potential energy between the two vesicles; the vesicle volume and surface area constraints are imposed using a penalty method. Numerical results are provided to verify the efficacy of our model and to provide visual illustrations of the different types of contact. The method can be adjusted to solve endocytosis problems by modifying the bending rigidity coefficients of the two elastic bending energies. The method can also be extended to simulate multi-cell adhesions, one example of which is erythrocyte rouleaux. A comparison with laboratory observations demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-phase field approach.",

The current study investigated the similarities and differences of reading skills and eye movement behavior between a sample of 25 low-skilled adult readers and 25 first grade students matched on word reading skill. t tests for matched pairs found no significant differences on language comprehension, reading comprehension, or eye movement variables. Regression analyses revealed that language comprehension made greater contributions to reading comprehension for adults (verses children) in the simple view of reading model. Processing time (gaze duration) was found to account for unique variance in both passage reading comprehension and sentence comprehension efficiency after controlling for word reading and language skills for adults. For children, processing time was only a significant predictor for sentence comprehension efficiency.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Students' lives outside of college can have dramatic effects on academic outcomes (e.g., grades, persistence, graduation). However, the manner in which students' lives outside of college are referenced in college-effects models suggests some uncertainty among scholars as to which, and how, student experiences outside of an institution affect college student outcomes. Using longitudinal data from a racially diverse sample of 3914 students (997 White, 1051 Black, 915 Hispanic, and 951 Asian) attending 28 institutions, this study employs logistic regression models to examine relationships between three types of non-college life-events and students' likelihood of graduation. Specifically, we examine the impact of financial disruptions, grieving a friend's or family member's death, and other family situations that likely cause psychological distress for students. Results suggest that major life-events are both common (i.e., affecting over 52 % of students) and consequential (i.e., negatively affecting graduation rates), thus warranting increased attention from researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent reports suggest that an increasing number of organizations are using information from social media platforms such as Facebook.com to screen job applicants. Unfortunately, empirical research concerning the potential implications of this practice is extremely limited. We address the use of social media for selection by examining how recruiter ratings of Facebook profiles fare with respect to two important criteria on which selection procedures are evaluated: criterion-related validity and subgroup differences (which can lead to adverse impact). We captured Facebook profiles of college students who were applying for full-time jobs, and recruiters from various organizations reviewed the profiles and provided evaluations. We then followed up with applicants in their new jobs. Recruiter ratings of applicants' Facebook information were unrelated to supervisor ratings of job performance (rs = -.13 to -.04), turnover intentions (rs = -.05 to .00), and actual turnover (rs = -.01 to .01). In addition, Facebook ratings did not contribute to the prediction of these criteria beyond more traditional predictors, including cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and personality. Furthermore, there was evidence of subgroup difference in Facebook ratings that tended to favor female and White applicants. The overall results suggest that organizations should be very cautious about using social media information such as Facebook to assess job applicants.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Here we consider the role of depth as a driver of evolution in a genus of deep-sea fishes. We provide a phylogeny for the genus Coryphaenoides (Gadiformes: Macrouridae) that represents the breadth of habitat use and distributions for these species. In our consensus phylogeny species found at abyssal depths (>4000 m) form a well-supported lineage, which interestingly also includes two non -abyssal species, C. striaturus and C. murrayi, diverging from the basal node of that lineage. Biogeographic analyses suggest the genus may have originated in the Southern and Pacific Oceans where contemporary species diversity is highest. The abyssal lineage seems to have arisen secondarily and likely originated in the Southern/Pacific Oceans but diversification of this lineage occurred in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. All abyssal species are found in the North Atlantic with the exception of C. yaquinae in the North Pacific and C filicauda in the Southern Ocean. Abyssal species tend to have broad depth ranges and wide distributions, indicating that the stability of the deep oceans and the ability to live across wide depths may promote population connectivity and facilitate large ranges. We also confirm that morphologically defined subgenera do not agree with our phylogeny and that the Giant grenadier (formerly Albatrossia pectoralis) belongs to Coryphaenoides, indicating that a taxonomic revision of the genus is needed. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the radiation and diversification of this genus, and the likely role of adaptation to the abyss. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The resultant nanocomposites contained a high volume fraction of CNTs (60 vol%), and due to alignment, reached an electrical conductivity of up to 22 x 10(5) S m(-1). The electrical conductivity was anisotropic based upon the CNT alignment and changed from 3.3 to 9.2 after the pyrolysis process.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper, a novel three-dimensional-linked (3D-linked) carbon fiber-carbon nanotube (C-f-CNT) hybrid structure is presented to improve the through-thickness thermal properties of polymer derived silicon carbonitride matrix composites. Comparing with pristine plain woven carbon fiber, the pores in the criss-cross position are fully filled with carbon nanotubes (CNT) in the presented C-f-CNT hybrid structure. CNT can be integrated in between the plain woven carbon fibers and generate a 3D-linked C-f-CNT hybrid network structure. Thanks to the percolating network of CNT and the densification effect, the through-thickness thermal conductivity of the resultant ceramic matrix composites is improved significantly, which is enhanced by 10% with short CNT and by 31% with long CNT, respectively. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with temperature from 100 to 900 degrees C for these composites. Multiphysics simulation is conducted to reveal the effects of the 3D-linked C-f-CNT hybrid structure on the thermal conductivity at various temperatures, which are consistent with experimental results.

      "Abstract Note" : "Two lowland lowland catchments in the U.K. were sampled throughout 2010-11 to investigate the dominant controls on dissolved organic matter quantity and composition. The catchments had marked differences in terms of nutrient status, land cover and contrasting lithologies resulting in differences in the dominant flow pathways (groundwater vs. surface water dominated). The Upper Wylye is a chalk stream with a baseflow index of 0.98, draining a catchment dominated by intensive agricultural production. Millersford Brook is a lowland peat catchment with a baseflow index of 0.43, chaining a semi-natural catchment. with heather moorland and coniferous forest Samples were collected weekly between October 2010 and September 2011 from eleven sampling locations. Samples were analysed to determine dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fractions with DOM composition evaluated via the DOC:DON ratio, DOC:DOP ratio, specific UV absorption a1254 nm, absorbance ratio (a(250):a(365)) and the spectral slope parameter between 350 and 400 nm (S350-400). Significant differences were observed in all determinands between the catchments, over time, and spatially along nutrient enrichment and geoclimaLic gradients. Seasonal variation in preferential flow pathways mobil ising groundwater-derived DOM were identified as likely controls on the delivery of DOM in the permeable chalk dominated catchment. Steeper S350-400 values and elevated 0250:03 5 ratios in this catchment suggest material of a lower bulk aromatic C content and molecular weight delivered during the winter months when compared to the summer. DOC:DON ratios were markedly lower in the chalk catchment than the peatland catchment, reflecting the paucity of organic matter within the mineral soils of the chalk landscape, and higher fertiliser application rates. This manuscript highlights that DOM composition varies according to catchment landscape character and hydrological function. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "When Anna White Dildane, a prostitute and heroin addict, was committed to the Laboratory of Social Hygiene (LSH) in 1917, she was treated by a staff that anticipated the methods of the biopsychosocial model later developed by Engel. That is to say, the staff members believed that Anna's rehabilitation was contingent on a scientific diagnosis of the physical, mental, and social factors that underlay her condition. However, using Anna and the LSH as a case study, we draw from Latour to show the limitations of this modern method of diagnosis and treatment that persists today. Using Burke, we advocate for a pragmatic orientation focused on creating rhetorically oriented narratives whose aim is to help patients make judgments about their health and future, namely, by bringing about the experience of form capable of constituting new types of identification. Effective medical rhetoric thus adopts a method of persuasion that begins with the narrative and self-understanding of the patient, links aspects of that narrative with the technical expertise of physicians and other health care providers, and crafts a new, more specialized narrative attentive to the desires and constraints of a patient's form of identification that is ultimately the seat of judgment.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Since its conception, the quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) has been extensively studied, especially in renewable energy applications fields due to its ability to withstand shoot-through and provide continuous current. However, research thus far has only explored symmetric qZSI/ZSI impedance network with large inductances and capacitances. By utilizing next-gen wideband-gap devices at high-switching frequency, the impedance network can be significantly reduced. However, the reduced qZS impedance network will result in abnormal operation modes, in addition to frequency resonances, in several kilohertz range. Thus, this paper first thoroughly explains the occurrence of the abnormal states, analyzes the effects of the abnormal states on the frequency resonance, and then proposes a control method to suppress the resonance that result from the reduced impedance network. A 1-kW prototype is built and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the analysis and proposed control method.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Silica-barium carbonate biomorphs are complex precipitate microstructures that form by purely inorganic processes. They display life-like morphologies with smoothly curved surfaces that are not restricted to crystallographic symmetries. We investigate the morphogenetic influence of inorganic dopants that compete with the barium carbonate precipitation. Trace deposition of alkaline earth or transition metal additives causes significant changes to the crystal morphologies. In the case of Pb2+ and Ag+ ions, biomorph growth is disrupted by the formation of competing precipitates. Similarly, the addition of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ induces the rapid crystallization of witherite or amorphous silica carbonate aggregates at enhanced growth rates. By comparison, the addition of strontium ions results in the assembly of classic biomorphs such as cardioid sheets and helices. The procedures reported here exemplify the use of co-depositing agents to influence the compositional and crystallographic properties in a manner similar to magnesium-doped biogenic calcites.

      "Abstract Note" : "The mechanical properties of binary blends of propylene-1-hexene random copolymers (with 11 and 21 mol% 1-hexene) are studied in parallel with polymorphic transformations under uniaxial tensile deformation. The modulus, yield stress, and draw ratio of the pure PH copolymers decrease with increasing 1-hexene content, while for the blends the change of mechanical properties with composition is highly non-linear. The addition of just 10 wt % PH11 to PH21 doubles the elastic modulus and yield strength of the blends in reference to the value of PH21, reaching for all blends values close to the performance of pure PH11. The elongation at break and the ultimate tensile strength increase more gradually with content of PH11. On tensile deformation, pure components and blends undergo morphological and polymorphic transformations, such as a reversible lamellar to fibrillar transformation of trigonal PH21, or an irreversible a crystal to mesophase in pure PH11 and the blends. In blends and neat PH11, a fibrillar trigonal morphology that develops under deformation is stabilized by the transformation of a to mesophase, and remains after removing the load, explaining the lower elastic recovery of the blends compared to PH21. The formation of stress-induced trigonal crystallites in PH11 and blends after strains > 150% is explained as a decrease of the free energy barrier for nucleation of a phase that requires short iPP sequences.

      "Abstract Note" : "We present measurements of the reduction of light output by plastic scintillators irradiated in the CMS detector during the 8 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider and show that they indicate a strong dose rate effect. The damage for a given dose is larger for lower dose rate exposures. The results agree with previous measurements of dose rate effects, but are stronger due to the very low dose rates probed. We show that the scaling with dose rate is consistent with that expected from diffusion effects.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In a recent article, Foroughi, Werner, Barragan, and Boehm-Davis (2015) demonstrated that interspersing interruptions between paragraphs during reading sometimes reduces accuracy on comprehension questions. We propose an account of their findings within long-term working memory (LTWM) theory. Our account proposes that interruptions interfere with the accessibility of the generated encodings of the text in long-term memory (LTM) and that unimpaired continued comprehension requires restoration of access to these memory encodings during the resumption of reading after the interruptions. It is consistent with the accuracy of question answering being substantially preserved in their study, which is seemingly inconsistent with their transient storage account. This theoretical controversy does not diminish the importance of Foroughi et al.'s results: We agree that additional research is needed to understand when and how interruptions impact various aspects of comprehension.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Emotion perception is known to involve multiple operations and waves of analysis, but specific nature of these processes remains poorly understood. Combining psychophysical testing and neurometric analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs) in a fear detection task with parametrically varied fear intensities (N=45), we sought to elucidate key processes in fear perception. Building on psychophysics marking fear perception thresholds, our neurometric model fitting identified several putative operations and stages: four key processes arose in sequence following face presentation - fear-neutral categorization (P1 at 100 ms), fear detection (P300 at 320 ms), valuation (early subcomponent of the late positive potential/LPP at 400-500 ms) and conscious awareness (late subcomponent LPP at 500-600 ms). Furthermore, within-subject brain-behavior association suggests that initial emotion categorization was mandatory and detached from behavior whereas valuation and conscious awareness directly impacted behavioral outcome (explaining 17% and 31% of the total variance, respectively). The current study thus reveals the chronometry of fear perception, ascribing psychological meaning to distinct underlying processes. The combination of early categorization and late valuation of fear reconciles conflicting (categorical versus dimensional) emotion accounts, lending support to a hybrid model. Importantly, future research could specifically interrogate these psychological processes in various behaviors and psychopathologies (e.g., anxiety and depression). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "Using a multiple baseline across participants design, this study examines the functional relationship between instruction in note-taking skills and the ability of young adults with autism spectrum disorder to take notes on college lectures. The three participants were enrolled in a program aligned with the Higher Education Opportunity Act (Public Law 110-315) to support students with significant cognitive disabilities in attending community college classes. All had graduated high school on a special diploma status and had mild cognitive disabilities. Despite some variability in performance during baseline (when only the note-taking template was introduced), all three students demonstrated increased performance during intervention when they were taught skills such as distinguishing between subtopics and details, paraphrasing, and using abbreviations and symbols. Participants' improvements were maintained after the intervention instruction stopped. Participant Tau-U effect sizes ranged from 0.67 to 1.00, and the weighted average Tau-U effect size was 0.88 (CI95 = 0.53 to 1.24). The discussion addresses implications for the postsecondary participation of students with autism spectrum disorder as well as possible changes needed in their secondary education.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This exploratory case study examined the process and potential impact of collaborative architectural design and construction in an OpenSimulator-based virtual reality (VR) on the social skills development of children with high-functioning autism (HFA). Two children with a formal medical diagnosis of HFA and one typically developing peer, aged 8-11, were purposefully recruited and matched in a five-week, VR-based architectural design project. Participants' virtual behaviors and discourses were observed and archived via screen recording. We conducted qualitative time-series and micro-behavior analyses with the data collected. The findings demonstrated that VR-based collaborative design has awarded children with HFA an opportunity to practice and develop flexibility, identity, and norm construction. The target children's design-based social performance was mediated by the VR environment, the context or structure of design partnership, and the nature of a specific design task.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although the biomedical model has dominated U.S. health care for more than a century, it has failed to adequately address current U.S. health care challenges, including the treatment and prevention of chronic disease; the epidemic rise in diabetes is one important example. In response, newer models of health care have been developed that address patients' mental and physical health concerns by multidisciplinary care teams that place the patient and family in the center of shared decision making. These new models of care offer many important opportunities for psychologists to play a larger role in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. However, for psychology's role to be fully realized, both external and internal challenges must be addressed. This will require psychologists to become more interdisciplinary, more familiar with the larger health care culture, more willing to expand their skill sets, and more collaborative with other health disciplines both from a patient-care and a larger advocacy perspective.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: High rates of vitamin D deficiency have been reported in athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the associations between vitamin D with bone health and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations in female runners who trained at 30.4 degrees degrees north. Methods: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D), PTH, body composition, and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured in 59 female runners, aged 18-40 years. Stress fracture history, training duration and frequency were evaluated by questionnaire. As per National Endocrine Society cut-offs, serum vitamin D ranges were: 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L for deficient; 50-75 nmol/L for insufficient; and 75 nmol/L for sufficient status. Results: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 122.6 +/- 63.9 nmol/L, with 18.6% of subjects in the deficient (5.1%) or insufficient (13.5%) range. No significant differences were observed between sufficient and deficient/insufficient subjects for BMD, PTH, history of stress fractures, or demographic data. Conclusions: The majority of distance runners maintained sufficient vitamin D status, suggesting that training outdoors in latitude where vitamin D synthesis occurs year-round reduces the risk for vitamin D deficiency. Data do not support the indiscriminate supplementation of outdoor athletes in southern latitudes without prior screening.",

We argue that China offers not only location advantages (e.g., economic growth) that encourage MNCs to establish R&D centers there, but also location disadvantages (e.g., weak intellectual, property protection) that discourage MNCs from doing so. Examining a sample of China R&D centers established by U.S. MNCs over fifteen years, we find that China's location advantages and location disadvantages have both independent and joint effects on MNCs' establishment of China R&D centers. We also find that MNC attributes, moderate these effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are important for a variety of mental health outcomes and have been shown to improve both mood and behaviors. However, there is little consensus on whether omega 3 fatty acids are beneficial for reducing aggressive behaviors. The current study assesses the relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and aggression. A total of 73 effect sizes were calculated among 40 studies involving 7173 participants from both intervention and observational research designs. Effect sizes were separately meta-analyzed for two-group comparison studies (SMD = 0.20), pre-post contrast studies (ESsg = 0.62), and associational studies (r= -0.06), in the fixed-effect model. Results from the random effects model also suggest a range of effects of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing aggression (SMD = 0.24; ESsg = 0.82; r= 0.09). Patterns in the relationship between omega-3s and aggression were additionally observed. Moderator analyses indicated that the effect of omega-3s on aggression is conditioned by how aggressive behaviors are measured, such as through self-report or parent/teacher surveys.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Dating violence is a serious and prevalent problem, with females being victimized by partners at high rates with numerous negative health consequences. Previous research has been equivocal on whether substance use on the part of the victim temporally precedes and, thus, increases the odds of victimization. Although the sole responsibility for violence is always with the perpetrator, knowing this information could provide useful information for theory as well as interventions designed to keep women safe. Method: Participants were female college students in a current dating relationship who had consumed alcohol in the previous month (N = 173). Students completed daily surveys on their violence victimization, alcohol use, and marijuana use for up to 90 consecutive days. Results: On any drinking days, heavy drinking days, and as the number of alcoholic drinks consumed increased, women were more likely to be victimized by psychological, physical, and sexual dating violence. Marijuana use also preceded and increased the odds of sexual victimization. Relationship length moderated some of these temporal associations, such that the odds of victimization on a drinking day, or marijuana use day, were increased for participants in longer relationships. Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of considering the role that alcohol and marijuana use play in increasing the risk for dating violence victimization among women. Intervention programs for dating violence may benefit by attempting to decrease substance use to reduce risk for female victims.",

During a charging test up to 60 A in a bath of liquid nitrogen at 77 K, the test coil showed 'defect-irrelevant' behaviors, i.e. coil terminal voltages and center fields in steady-state operations were barely discernible from those of an ideal 'defect-free' coil. Also, the critical current (Ic) of the coil was measured to be 68 A, close to 72 A estimated from the measured Ic angular dependency data of a defect-free sample tape that was used for construction of the coil. The results demonstrate a potential to build a pancake coil with REBCO tapes regardless of their defects, which may lead to a substantial reduction in the construction cost of high field NI REBCO magnets.",

      "Abstract Note" : "REBCO (RE = rare earth) based high temperature superconducting (HTS) wires are now being utilized for the development of electric and electromagnetic devices for various industrial, scientific and medical applications. In the last several years, the increasing efforts in using the so-called second generation (2G) HTS wires for some of the applications require a further increase in their engineering current density (J(e)). The applications are those typically related to high magnetic fields where the higher J(e) of a REBCO wire, in addition to its higher irreversibility fields and higher mechanical strength, is already a major advantage over other superconducting wires. An effective way to increase the J(e) is to decrease the total thickness of a wire, for which using a thinner substrate becomes an obvious and attractive approach. By using our IBAD-MOCVD (ion beam assisted deposition-metal organic chemical vapor deposition) technology we have successfully made 2G HTS wires using a Hastelloy (R) C276 substrate that is only 30 mu m in thickness. By using this thinner substrate instead of the typical 50 mu m thick substrate and with a same critical current (I-c), the J(e) of a wire can be increased by 30% to 45% depending on the copper stabilizer thickness. In this paper, we report the fabrication and characterization of the 2G HTS wires made on the 30 mu m thick Hastelloy (R) C276 substrate. It was shown that with the optimization in the processing protocol, the surface of the thinner Hastelloy (R) C276 substrate can be readily electropolished to the quality needed for the deposition of the buffer stack. Same in the architecture as that on the standard 50 mu m thick substrate, the buffer stack made on the 30 mu m thick substrate showed an in-plane texture with a Delta phi of around 6.7 degrees in the LaMnO3 cap layer. Low-temperature in-field transport measurement results suggest that the wires on the thinner substrate had achieved equivalent superconducting performance, most importantly the I-c, as those on the 50 mu m thick substrate. It is expected the 2G HTS wires made on the 30 mu m thick Hastelloy (R) C276 substrate, the thinnest and with the highest J(e) to date, will greatly benefit such applications as high field magnets and high current cables.",

Yet, past work has not examined changes in these processes during smoking cessation treatment or their relation to smoking cessation outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of two smoking cessation interventions on changes in self-report and behavioral distress intolerance indices during treatment, and whether these changes are associated with smoking cessation outcomes. Treatment-seeking smokers (N = 384) were randomly assigned to one of two 4-session smoking cessation treatment programs: Standard Cessation Program (SCP) or Smoking Treatment and Anxiety Management Program (STAMP). Quit dates were scheduled to coincide with the final treatment session. Physical domains of distress intolerance were assessed at baseline and at each weekly session, via the Discomfort Intolerance Scale (DIS; higher scores indicate more intolerance for discomfort) and Breath Holding Duration Task (shorter durations indicate more intolerance for respiratory distress). The STAMP condition produced a greater rate of reduction in DIS scores than did the SCP condition. Changes in DIS scores during treatment mediated the effect of STAMP treatment on 7-day point prevalence abstinence at Month 3 post-quit attempt. There were no treatment conditions differences in changes in Breath-Holding duration. Data suggest self-reported distress intolerance is malleable in the context of stress sensitivity reduction treatment, but not standard smoking cessation treatment, and such reductions may result in promotion of smoking abstinence.

      "Abstract Note" : "We propose a new, optimally accurate numerical regularization/stabilization for (a family of) second order timestepping methods for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). The method combines a linear treatment of the advection term, together with stabilization terms that are proportional to discrete curvature of the solutions in both velocity and pressure. We rigorously prove that the entire new family of methods are unconditionally stable and O(Delta t(2)) accurate. The idea of 'curvature stabilization' is new to CFD and is intended as an improvement over the commonly used 'speed stabilization', which is only first order accurate in time and can have an adverse effect on important flow quantities such as drag coefficients. Numerical examples verify the predicted convergence rate and show the stabilization term clearly improves the stability and accuracy of the tested flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Social science research, public and private sector decisions, and allocations of federal resources often rely on data from the American Community Survey (ACS). However, this critical data source has high uncertainty in some of its most frequently used estimates. Using 2006-2010 ACS median household income estimates at the census tract scale as a test case, we explore spatial and nonspatial patterns in ACS estimate quality. We find that spatial patterns of uncertainty in the northern United States differ from those in the southern United States, and they are also different in suburbs than in urban cores. In both cases, uncertainty is lower in the former than the latter. In addition, uncertainty is higher in areas with lower incomes. We use a series of multivariate spatial regression models to describe the patterns of association between uncertainty in estimates and economic, demographic, and geographic factors, controlling for the number of responses. We find that these demographic and geographic patterns in estimate quality persist even after we account for the number of responses. Our results indicate that data quality varies across places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable. Finally, we present advice for data users and potential solutions to the challenges identified.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Social networking sites (SNSs) offer new avenues for interpersonal communication and self-presentation. We report a meta-analysis of 80 studies yielding 143 effect sizes on the effect of self-esteem, narcissism, and loneliness on SNS use. Total SNS use was higher, among people low in self-esteem, high in narcissism, and high in loneliness. Further analyses revealed high narcissism to be linked to all SNS activities (status updates, posting photographs, interacting/commenting on others, and total friends). High self-esteem (not low) was linked to having more online friends but no other activities. Links were stronger in studies with lower proportions of females and participants from non-Western, non-individualistic countries. We speculate that effects are somewhat diluted among females and Western samples by multiple reasons for SNS use, and further that low self-esteem participants constitute the so-called \"lurkers\" (i.e., people who browse but do not reveal themselves).

      "Abstract Note" : "Boundary-layer separation, a critical phenomenon in the operation of aerodynamic surfaces, limits the performance of compressor and turbine blades, fixed and rotary wings, as well as bluff bodies moving through a fluid. Flow separation leads to increased drag, decreased lift, and unpredictable vibrations due to unsteadiness. On these systems, effective control of separation could provide greater maneuverability and performance, and reduced vibration. Separated flow is a macroscale phenomenon governed by complex flow interactions, but it can be controlled by microscale actuation. Recently, the emergence of closed-loop methods has enhanced robustness. Modern processors enable the use of sophisticated adaptive control methods that achieve separation control with adaptive models. This paper considers control of flow separation over a NACA-0025 airfoil using microjet actuators. Experimental results are presented for a novel approach to nonlinear model predictive control, referred to as adaptive sampling-based model predictive control, which applies the minimal resource allocation network algorithm for nonlinear system identification and the sampling-based model predictive optimization algorithm to achieve effective nonlinear control. Through pressure data and flow characterization from wind-tunnel experiments, effective and robust separation control is demonstrated. The method's computational efficiency is sufficient for successful real-time experimental implementation.",

Less is known about its role in other brain areas. Here, we compared the effects of mating versus cocaine history on induction of Delta FosB in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), an integral site for reproductive behavior, and in the NAc. Delta FosB immunoreactivity (ir) was increased in the MPOA of previously naive and experienced male rats that mated the day before euthanasia, compared to unmated controls and experienced males with recent mating abstinence. Western immunoblots confirmed that the 35-37-kDa isoform of Delta FosB was increased more in recently mated males. Conversely, previous plus recent cocaine did not increase Delta FosB-ir in the MPOA, despite an increase in the NAc. Next, a viral vector expressing Delta FosB, its dominant negative antagonist Delta JunD, or green fluorescent protein (GFP) control, were microinjected bilaterally into the MPOA. Delta FosB overexpression impaired copulation and promoted female-directed aggression, compared to Delta JunD and control males. These data suggest that Delta FosB in the mPOA is expressed in an experience-dependent manner and affects systems that coordinate mating and aggression.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper examines the roles of radiative and non-radiative air-sea coupled thermodynamic processes in modifying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies driven by (air-sea coupled) oceanic dynamic processes, focusing on their contributions to the key differences between the eastern Pacific (EP) El Nio and the central Pacific (CP) El Nio. The attribution is achieved by decomposing SST anomalies into partial temperature anomalies due to individual processes using a coupled atmosphere-surface climate feedback-response analysis method. Oceanic processes induce warming from the central to the eastern equatorial Pacific and cooling over the western basin with a maximum warming center in the central Pacific for both types of El Nio. The processes that act to oppose the oceanic process-induced SST anomalies are surface latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, cloud, and atmospheric dynamic feedbacks, referred to as negative-feedback processes. The cooling due to each of the four negative-feedback processes is the strongest in the region where the initial warming due to oceanic processes is the largest. Water-vapor feedback is the sole process that acts to enhance the initial warming induced by oceanic processes. The increase in atmospheric water vapor over the eastern Pacific is much stronger for the EP El Nio than for the CP El Nio. It is the strong water-vapor feedback over the eastern Pacific and the strong negative feedbacks over the central equatorial Pacific that help to relocate the maximum warming center from the central Pacific to the eastern basin for the EP El Nio.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Deep hierarchical representations of the data have been found out to provide better informative features for several machine learning applications. In addition, multilayer neural networks surprisingly tend to achieve better performance when they are subject to an unsupervised pretraining. The booming of deep learning motivates researchers to identify the factors that contribute to its success. One possible reason identified is the flattening of manifold-shaped data in higher layers of neural networks. However, it is not clear how to measure the flattening of such manifold-shaped data and what amount of flattening a deep neural network can achieve. For the first time, this paper provides quantitative evidence to validate the flattening hypothesis. To achieve this, we propose a few quantities for measuring manifold entanglement under certain assumptions and conduct experiments with both synthetic and real-world data. Our experimental results validate the proposition and lead to new insights on deep learning.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The present work examined the influence of drinking motives on hookah use frequency among individuals reporting both alcohol and hookah use (multi-substance users). Despite growing documentation of cross-substance effects between motives and substance use, limited research has examined these relationships specifically with respect to hookah use. Participants were 134 (75.37 % female) hookah and alcohol users, aged 18-47 years (M = 22.17, SD = 3.66) who completed measures of substance use, drinking motives, and reported demographic information. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate the predictive value of drinking motives on hookah use frequency, age taken into account. Findings showed that hookah use was negatively associated with age (beta = - .22, p aecurrency sign . 01). The model regressing hookah use on the four drinking motives provided adequate fit (chi (2) = 314.31, df = 180, p < .05, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .075 [95 % CI, .06-.09]). Hookah use was associated negatively with social motives (beta = - .43, p aecurrency sign . 001) and positively with conformity motives (beta = .24, p aecurrency sign . 05). These findings are consistent with multi-substance use literature suggesting that drinking motives are associated with the use of other substances, including increased hookah use frequency. Additional examinations of cross-substance cognitive processes are needed, particularly with respect to understanding whether hookah use among multi-substance users may be contingent in part on individual factors including negative affectivity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Eighty years after the invention of continuous cast of steels, reproducibility from few mm(3) samples in the laboratory to m(3) product in plants is still a challenge. We have engineered a thermal simulation method to simulate the continuous casting process. The temperature gradient (G (L) ) and dendritic growth rate (v) of the slab were reproduced by controlling temperature and cooling intensity at hot and chill end, respectively, in our simulation samples. To verify that our samples can simulate the cast slab in continuous casting process, the heat transfer, solidification structure, and macrosegregation of the simulating sample were compared to those of a much larger continuous casting slab. The morphology of solid/liquid interface, solidified shell thickness, and dendritic growth rate were also investigated by in situ quenching the solidifying sample. Shell thickness (delta) determined by our quenching experiment was related to solidification time (tau) by equation: delta = 4.27 x tau (0.38). The results indicated that our method closely simulated the solidification process of continuous casting.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The induction, formation and maintenance of memory represent dynamic processes modulated by multiple factors including the circadian clock and sleep. Chronic sleep restriction has become common in modern society due to occupational and social demands. Given the impact of cognitive impairments associated with sleep deprivation, there is a vital need for a simple animal model in which to study the interactions between chronic sleep deprivation and memory. We used the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, with its simple nervous system, nocturnal sleep pattern and well-characterized learning paradigms, to assess the effects of two chronic sleep restriction paradigms on short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) associative memory. The effects of sleep deprivation on memory were evaluated using the operant learning paradigm, learning that food is inedible, in which the animal associates a specific netted seaweed with failed swallowing attempts. We found that two nights of 6 h sleep deprivation occurring during the first or last half of the night inhibited both STM and LTM. Moreover, the impairment in STM persisted for more than 24 h. A milder, prolonged sleep deprivation paradigm consisting of 3 consecutive nights of 4 h sleep deprivation also blocked STM, but had no effect on LTM. These experiments highlight differences in the sensitivity of STM and LTM to chronic sleep deprivation. Moreover, these results establish Aplysia as a valid model for studying the interactions between chronic sleep deprivation and associative memory paving the way for future studies delineating the mechanisms through which sleep restriction affects memory formation.

      "Abstract Note" : "Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 and paired stones represent unique samples of martian polymict regolith breccia. Multiple breccia subsamples characterized in this work confirm highly siderophile element (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd) contents that are consistently elevated (e.g., Os similar to 9.3-18.4 ppb) above indigenous martian igneous rocks (mostly <5 ppb Os), equivalent to similar to 3 wt% of admixed CI-type carbonaceous chondritic material, and occur in broadly chondrite-relative proportions. However, a protracted history of impactor component (metal and sulfide) breakdown and redistribution of the associated HSE has masked the original nature of the admixed meteorite signatures. The present-day Os-187/Os-188 ratios of 0.119-0.136 record a wider variation than observed for all major chondrite types. Combined with the measured Re-187/Os-188 ratios of 0.154-0.994, the range in Os isotope ratios indicates redistribution of Re and Os from originally chondritic components early in the history of the regolith commencing at similar to 4.4 Ga. Superimposed recent Re mobility reflects exposure and weathering at or near the martian and terrestrial surfaces. Elevated Os concentrations (38.0 and 92.6 ppb Os), superchondritic Os/HSE ratios, and Os-187/Os-188 of 0.1171 and 0.1197 measured for two subsamples of the breccia suggest the redistribution of impactor material at similar to 1.5-1.9 Ga, possibly overlapping with a (partial) resetting event at similar to 1.4 Ga recorded by U-Pb isotope systematics in the breccia. Martian alteration of the originally chondritic HSE host phases, to form Os-Ir-rich nuggets and Ni-rich pyrite, implies the influence of potentially impact-driven hydrothermal systems. Multiple generations of impactor component admixture, redistribution, and alteration mark the formation and evolution of the martian regolith clasts and matrix of NWA 7034 and paired meteorites, from the pre-Noachian until impact ejection to Earth.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents the mathematical formulation and unique capability of a system-level ship thermal management tool, vemESRDC, developed to provide quick ship thermal responses in early design stages. The physical model combines principles of classical thermodynamics and heat transfer, along with appropriate empirical correlations to simplify the model and expedite the computations. As a result, the tool is capable of simulating dynamic thermal response of an entire ship, characterized by intricate thermal interactions within a complex ship structure, within an acceptable time frame. In this work, vemESRDC is demonstrated through three case studies in which transient thermal responses of an all-electric ship to different ship operation modes, weather conditions, and partial loss of cooling are investigated. The analysis examines particularly the following: (1) the required cooling capacities to maintain each ship component within its design limit; (2) equipment temperature variations with respect to partial cooling loss in battle mode; and (3) the assets of installing seawater heat exchangers to pre-cool deionized freshwater before chillers. For the notional all-electric ship conceived and assessed in this work, the results verify the capability of vemESRDC to capture dynamic thermal interactions between shipboard equipment and their respective surroundings and cooling systems, e.g., the tool provides practical insights into pulse load cooling strategy, and different solutions are obtained for distinct weather conditions. In addition to the case studies performed in this work, vemESRDC can be employed to conduct diverse studies based on which concrete ship thermal management strategies can be formulated in early design stages.

      "Abstract Note" : "Chromium oxide, Cr2O5, was synthesized by pyrolyzing CrO3 at 350 degrees C and employed as a new cathode in rechargeable sodium ion batteries. Cr2O5/Na rechargeable batteries delivered high specific capacities up to 310 mAhig at a current density of C/16 (or 20 mA/g). High-resolution solid-state Na-23 NMR both qualitatively and quantitatively revealed the reversible intercalation of Na ions into the bulk electrode and participation of Na ions in the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase largely at low potentials. Amorphization of the electrode structure occurred during the first discharge revealed by both NMR and X-ray diffraction data. CrO3-catalyzed electrolyte degradation and loss in electronic conductivity led to gradual capacity fading. The specific capacity stabilized at > 120 mAhig after 50 charge-discharge cycles. Further improvement in electrochemical performance is possible via electrode surface modification, polymer binder incorporation, or designs of new morphologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: To conduct a model-driven meta-analysis of correlational research on psychological and motivational predictors of diabetes outcomes, with adherence factors as mediators. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of published and unpublished studies located a sample of 775 individual correlational or predictive studies reported across 739 research reports. Results: Results varied according to the outcome variable included in the regression models. Depression had a larger negative effect on adherence to physical activity than on dietary adherence. Coping and self-efficacy were strongly related to dietary adherence, which was strongly related to improved glycemic control. Medication adherence was related to glycosylated hemoglobin, whereas medications and self-monitoring were related to fasting blood glucose. Adding appointment keeping to the models did not significantly alter the results. Conclusion: Self-efficacy was the most consistent predictor of all adherence behaviors and dietary adherence was the most significant predictor of HbA1c. Physical activity was the most predictive factor of BMI and glucose self-monitoring the most predictive of FBG. Practice implications: Metabolic control is a primary goal in T2DM, so the best pathway to attaining that goal appears to be an emphasis on self-efficacy and dietary adherence.

      "Abstract Note" : "Recently, scholars have increasingly criticized descriptions of significant penal change as rupturessudden breaks with past practices, often replacing old technologies with new. This article promotes an alternative understanding of penal change as the layering of new penal technologies over old technologies to describe the complicated coexistence of old and new penal technologies following significant moments of change. This study demonstrates the layering process through a case study of the first major American penal reform: proto-prisons adopted between 1785 and 1822 are often described as the first great rupture in which long-term incarceration replaced capital punishment. Using the relationship between America's emerging proto-prisons and declining death penalty, this article illustrates the complicated coexistence of penal reforms with older technologies. While proto-prisons emerged out of revulsion with capital punishment, many states adopted proto-prisons independently of their decisions to reduce capital offenses and most states retained relatively robust death penalties. Rather than a replacement or rupture, the emergence of proto-prisons represented an additional layer of punishment that partially displaced older technologies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Overpressure (OP) processing increases the critical current density (JC) of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (2212) round wires by shrinking the surrounding Ag matrix around the 2212 filaments, driving them close to full density and greatly increasing the 2212 grain connectivity. Indeed densification is vital for attaining the highest JC. Here, we investigate the time and temperature dependence of the wire densification. We find that the wire diameter decreases by 3.8 +/- 0.3% after full heat treatment at 50 atm and 100 atm OP. At 50 atm OP pressure, the filaments start densifying above 700 degrees C and reach a 3.30 +/- 0.07% smaller diameter after 2 h at 820 degrees C, which is below the melting point of 2212 powder. The densification is homogeneous and does not change the filament shape before melting. The growth of non-superconducting phases is observed at 820 degrees C, suggesting that time should be minimized at high temperature prior to melting the 2212 powder. Study of an open-ended 2.2 m long wire sample shows that full densification and the high OP JC (JC varies by about 3.1 times over the 2.2 m long wire) is reached about 1 m from the open ends, thus showing that coil-length wires can be protected from leaky seals by adding at least 1 m of sacrificial wire at each end.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The triarchic model characterizes psychopathy in terms of three distinct dispositional constructs of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. The model can be operationalized through scales designed specifically to index these domains or by using items from other inventories that provide coverage of related constructs. The present study sought to develop and validate scales for assessing the triarchic model domains using items from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF). A consensus rating approach was used to identify items relevant to each triarchic domain, and following psychometric refinement, the resulting MMPI-2-RF-based triarchic scales were evaluated for convergent and discriminant validity in relation to multiple psychopathy-relevant criterion variables in offender and nonoffender samples. Expected convergent and discriminant associations were evident very clearly for the Boldness and Disinhibition scales and somewhat less clearly for the Meanness scale. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that all MMPI-2-RF triarchic scales incremented standard MMPI-2-RF scale scores in predicting extant triarchic model scale scores. The widespread use of MMPI-2-RF in clinical and forensic settings provides avenues for both clinical and research applications in contexts where traditional psychopathy measures are less likely to be administered.",

      "Abstract Note" : "When something captures our attention, why does it do so? This topic has been hotly debated, with some arguing that attention is captured only by salient stimuli (bottom-up view) and others arguing capture is always due to a match between a stimulus and our goals (top-down view). Many different paradigms have provided evidence for 1 view or the other. If either of these strong views are correct, then capture represents a unitary phenomenon, and there should be a high correlation between capture in these paradigms. But if there are different types of capture (top-down, bottom-up), then some attention capture effects should be correlated and some should not. In 2 studies, we collected data from several paradigms used in support of claims of top-down and bottom-up capture in relatively large samples of participants. Contrary to either prediction, measures of capture were not strongly correlated. Results suggest that capture may in fact be strongly determined by idiosyncratic task demands and strategies. Relevant to this lack of relations among tasks, we observed that classic measures of attention capture demonstrated low reliability, especially among measures used to support bottom-up capture. Implications for the low reliability of capture measures are discussed. We also observed that the proportion of participants demonstrating a pattern of responses consistent with capture varied widely among classic measures of capture. Overall, results demonstrate that, even for relatively simple laboratory measures of attention, there are still important gaps in knowledge regarding what these paradigms measure and how they are related.",

To date, however, no research has explored these issues in a sample of Saudi Arabian youth. The current study addressed this gap in the literature and examined the lifetime use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among Saudi Arabian youth. We also examined whether key measures from social learning theory and low self-control theory were able to account for patterns of usage. Data drawn from a sample of nearly 500 youth residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were used. Analysis of the data revealed that 12.7% of youth had smoked cigarettes at least 1 time, 2.6% had consumed alcohol at least once, and 3.0% had used illegal drugs. Moreover, the results of rare-events logistic regression revealed that a measure of delinquent peers was the strongest and most consistent predictor of substance use, while a measure of low self-control was unrelated (or related in a direction opposite to that which was predicted) to the measures of substance use.",

Further, some research has indicated that this form of parenting may have a deleterious effect on emerging adult college students' mental health. This study examines the factor structure of the Helicopter Parenting Behaviors measure, a recent scale developed to examine intrusive and supportive parenting behaviors, by using confirmatory factor analysis. We utilized a self-determination theoretical framework to replicate and expand current research regarding the impact of helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting on emerging adult mental and physical well-being. Further, we examined self-efficacy as a mechanism for helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting to impact well-being, using structural equation modeling with a sample of 461 emerging adult college students from a large southeastern, United States university. The two-factor structure of the Helicopter Parenting Behaviors measure was confirmed, indicating helicopter parenting and autonomy supportive parenting are two unique, but related, constructs. Both autonomy supportive parenting and helicopter parenting were found to have indirect effects on anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, and physical health through self-efficacy. Results also indicated autonomy supportive parenting was directly related to life satisfaction and physical health when accounting for self-efficacy, whereas helicopter parenting was not directly related to well-being. This study adds to the extant literature by its' application of a family-level lens to the self-determination theory, its' advancement of parenting behaviors measurement, and its' exploration of the continued influence of parenting during emerging adulthood.",

The method requires the user to define a set of functions which must be carried out by the fleet, as well as a set of candidate vehicles or systems that can carry out these functions. These function and fleet models are then evaluated to determine their performance. All the data is then fed into a stochastic dynamic fleet operation model to identify the amount of vehicles or systems needed to complete each mission defined on a fixed time horizon. The output of the fleet operation model is then used by cost models to determine the cost of completing each fleet mission. The overall approach is demonstrated on a military fleet composed of two different types of vehicle: a conventional fleet and a fleet composed of modules. The method shows the potential for savings using a modular fleet for a hypothetical fleet mission profile; more work in this area is suggested.",

The topological modifications due to this selenium chain alignment result in inefficient atomic packing in the liquid structure that is manifested in a decrease in the glass density and may have important implications in understanding the pronounced non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior observed in Se-rich chalcogenide glasses/liquids.

      "Abstract Note" : "Moffitt's taxonomy remains an influential theoretical framework within criminology. Despite much empirical scrutiny, comparatively less time has been spent testing the snares component of Moffitt's work. Specifically, are there factors that might engender continued criminal involvement for individuals otherwise likely to desist? The current study tested whether gang membership increased the odds of contact with the justice system for each of the offender groups specified in Moffitt's original developmental taxonomy. Our findings provided little evidence that gang membership increased the odds of either adolescence-limited or life-course persistent offenders being processed through the criminal justice system. Moving forward, scholars may wish to shift attention to alternative variablesbeyond gang membershipwhen testing the snares hypothesis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We used stealth assessment, embedded in a game called Use Your Brainz (a slightly modified version of Plants vs. Zombies 2), to measure middle-school students' problem solving skills. We began by developing a problem solving competency model based on a review of the relevant literature. We then identified in-game indicators that would provide evidence about students' levels on various problem-solving facets. Our problem solving Model was then implemented in the game via Bayesian networks. To validate the stealth assessment, we collected data from students who played the game-based assessment for three hours and completed two external problem solving measures (i.e., Raven's Progressive Matrices and 'MicroDYN). Results indicated that the problem solving estimates derived from the game significantly correlated with the external measures, which suggests that our stealth assessment is valid. Our next steps include running a larger validation study and developing tools to help educators interpret the results of the assessment, which will subsequently support the development of problem solving skills.

      "Abstract Note" : "A transient mathematical model for managing microalgae derived hydrogen production as a source of renewable energy is developed for a well stirred photobioreactor. The model allows for the determination of microalgae and hydrogen mass fractions produced by the photobioreactor with respect to time. A Michaelis-Menten type expression is proposed for modeling the rate of hydrogen production, which introduces a mathematical expression to calculate the resulting effect on H-2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The so called indirect biophotolysis process was used. Therefore, a singular opportunity was identified to optimize the aerobic (t(1)), to anaerobic (t(2)), stages time ratio of the cycle for maximum H-2 production rate, i.e., the process rhythm. A system thermodynamic optimization is conducted through the complete model equations to find accurately the optimal system operating rhythm for maximum hydrogen production rate, and how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other. The maxima found are sharp, showing up to a similar to 60% variation in hydrogen production rate for t(2,opt) +/- 1 day, which highlights the importance of system operation in optimal rhythm. Therefore, the model is expected to be useful for design, control and optimization of hydrogen production as a source of renewable energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The mortgage market collapse which followed the burst of the housing bubble in 2007 led to unprecedented levels of mortgage default, mortgage foreclosure, and housing vacancies. The dramatic increase in mortgage terminations prompted extensive discussions among academics, industry practitioners, regulators, and policymakers. These discussions included such issues as the underlying causes of the mortgage market collapse and the impact of declining house prices on mortgage default and foreclosure. This special issue results from the 2013 FSU-UF Critical Issues Symposium entitled \"Housing Market Issues: Initiatives, Policies and the Economy\" where the impact of the recent market collapse was examined on topics such as the negative spillover effect of foreclosure, the determinants of mortgage default and prepayment, disequilibrium models of the housing market, and the growth of the reverse mortgage market. This introductory paper serves to set the stage by relating the papers in this special issue to the previous literature. It provides both a clear picture of the state of knowledge in these critical areas and the significant contributions of these recent studies.",

An unresolved issue is whether these negative spillover effects disappear after the REO is sold. We hypothesize that these effects are greater if the REO is purchased by an investor in comparison to an owner-occupant. In this paper we report the results from estimating the spillover effects of both current and ex-REOs, where the latter are divided into those possessed by owner-occupants and those possessed by investors. The results lend considerable support to our hypothesis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A well-known issue in phylogenetics is discordance among gene trees, species trees, morphology, and other data types. Gene-tree discordance is often caused by incomplete lineage sorting, lateral gene transfer, and gene duplication. Multispecies-coalescent methods can account for incomplete lineage sorting and are believed by many to be more accurate than concatenation. However, simulation studies and empirical data have demonstrated that concatenation and species tree methods often recover similar topologies. We use three popular methods of phylogenetic reconstruction (one concatenation, two species tree) to evaluate relationships within Teiidae. These lizards are distributed across the United States to Argentina and the West Indies, and their classification has been controversial due to incomplete sampling and the discordance among various character types (chromosomes, DNA, musculature, osteology, etc.) used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Recent morphological and molecular analyses of the group resurrected three genera and created five new genera to resolve non-monophyly in three historically ill-defined genera: Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, and Tupinambis. Here, we assess the phylogenetic relationships of the Teiidae using \"next-generation\" anchored-phylogenomics sequencing. Our final alignment includes 316 loci (488,656 bp DNA) for 244 individuals (56 species of teiids, representing all currently recognized genera) and all three methods (ExaML, MP-EST, and ASTRAL-II) recovered essentially identical topologies. Our results are basically in agreement with recent results from morphology and smaller molecular datasets, showing support for monophyly of the eight new genera. Interestingly, even with hundreds of loci, the relationships among some genera in Tupinambinae remain ambiguous (i.e. low nodal support for the position of Salvator and Dracaena).

The analyses revealed, in general, that bisexuals were the most delinquent of the sexual orientation categories for both males and females. Additional analyses revealed that heterosexual males reported significantly higher levels of both violent and nonviolent delinquency than gay males, whereas lesbians reported more involvement in nonviolent delinquency and, to a lesser extent, violent delinquency relative to heterosexual females. Analyses also revealed that lesbians reported significantly more delinquent behavior, particularly for nonviolent delinquency, than gay males.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Research suggests an important relationship between interpretation bias, hostility and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Extant literature has yet to examine hostile interpretation bias in clinically depressed samples; the current studies sought to fill this gap. Method: Study 1 participants included undergraduates who met criteria for MDD (n=36) or no anxiety or mood diagnosis (n=35). Each participant completed a structured clinical interview along with measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait hostility. In Study 2, a sample of treatment seeking individuals with elevated trait anger completed measures of depression, hostile interpretation bias, and trait anger. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that, relative to the non-depressed group, individuals with depression displayed greater hostile interpretation bias but comparable levels of trait hostility. In Study 2, greater hostile interpretation bias was associated with greater depressive symptoms, and this relationship was independent of co-occurring trait anger. Limitations: The correlational nature of these studies precludes interpretation of causal relationships between constructs. Additionally, replication of these results should be sought in a larger, more diverse sample. Conclusion: Overall, the findings suggest hostile interpretation bias may play a unique role in depression and could be a treatable feature of interpersonal mechanisms maintaining MDD.

      "Abstract Note" : "Only a portion of the population exposed to trauma will develop persistent emotional alterations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which illustrates the necessity for identifying vulnerability factors and novel pharmacotherapeutic alternatives. Interestingly, clinical evidence suggests that novelty seeking is a good predictor for vulnerability to the development of excessive and persistent fear. Here, we first tested this hypothesis by analyzing contextual and cued fear responses of rats selected for their high (high responders, HR) or low (low responders, LR) exploration of a novel environment, indicator of novelty seeking. While HR and LR rats exhibited similar sensitivity to the shock and cued fear memory retention, fewer extinction sessions were required in HR than LR animals to reach extinction, indicating faster contextual and cued memory extinction. In a second part, we found an effective disruption of contextual fear reconsolidation by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, associated with a down-regulation of early growth response 1 (Egr1) in the hippocampal CA1 area, and up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA levels in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. Altogether, these data demonstrate a link between novelty seeking and conditioned fear extinction, and highlight a promising novel role of ketamine in affecting established fear memory.

      "Abstract Note" : "Our study examines explanations for the paradox of older women's better emotional well-being compared with younger women. We consider the role of subjective experiences of aging in a society that devalues older women. Using a sample of women (n = 872) from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (1995-1996 and 2004-2006), we examine the role of five components of the subjective experience of aging in explaining older women's better emotional well-being compared with younger women: age identity, conceptions of the timing of middle age, aging attitudes, aging anxieties, and self-assessed physiological changes. We find that, compared with women 50-54 years old, those 35-39 years old report lower positive affect, and those 25-49 report higher negative affect. These patterns are partially explained by younger women's greater anxiety about declines in health and attractiveness and older women's more youthful identities. Our study underscores the value of considering the implications of our ageist and sexist society for women's emotional well-being across adulthood.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The problem of estimating a target-layer trajectory, modeled by a straight line, in 2D point clouds that contain target locations and overwhelming clutter is studied. These point clouds are generated by an image-based pre-processing tool, termed ATR, operating on SONAR image data that results in: (1) point locations and (2) an ATR score: a measure of the \"target-likeness\" for each point. The model of choice assumes that the observed point cloud is a superposition of two spatial processes: (1) a 1D Poisson process along the target-layer line, corrupted by 2D Gaussian noise, denoting target locations and (2) a 2D Poisson process denoting clutter. It is further assumed that the target-likeness measure follows known probability distributions for both target locations and clutter. The line is parameterized by distance from the origin and the angle with respect to a horizontal axis, and the likelihood of these parameters for observed data is derived. Using a maximum-likelihood approach, a gradient-based estimate for line parameters and other nuisance parameters is developed. A formal procedure that tests for the presence of a target-layer trajectory in the point cloud data is additionally developed. The success of this method in both simulated and real datasets collected by NSWC PCD is demonstrated. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

      "Abstract Note" : "From a public health perspective, primary care medical settings represent a strategic location to address mental health disapirty among Latinos. Yet, there is little empirical work that addresses affective vulnerability processes for mental health problems in such settings. To help address this gap in knowledge, the present investigation examined an interactive model of negative affectivity (tendency to experience negative mood states) and anxiety sensitivity (fear of the negative consequences of aversive sensations) among a Latino sample in primary care in terms of a relatively wide range of anxiety/depression indices. Participants included 390 Latino adults (M-age=38.7, SD=11.3; 86.9% female; 95.6% reported Spanish as first language) from a primary care health clinic. Primary dependent measures included depressive, suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability. Consistent with prediction, the interaction between negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity was significantly related to suicidal, social anxiety, and anxious arousal symptoms, as well as number of mood anxiety diagnoses and disability among the primary care Latino sample. The form of the interactions indicated a synergistic effect, such that the greatest levels of each outcome were found among those with high negative affectivity and high anxiety sensitivity. There was a trending interaction for depressive symptoms. Overall, these data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is a clinically-relevant interplay between anxiety sensitivity and negative affectivity in regard to the expression of anxiety and depressive symptoms among a Latino primary care sample.

      "Abstract Note" : "The photoproduction of omega and eta' mesons off carbon and niobium nuclei has been measured as a function of the meson momentum for incident photon energies of 1.2-2.9 GeV at the electron accelerator ELSA. The mesons have been identified via the omega -> pi(0)gamma -> 3 gamma and eta' -> pi(0)pi(0)eta -> 6 gamma decays, respectively, registered with the CBELSA/TAPS detector system. From the measured meson momentum distributions the momentum dependence of the transparency ratio has been determined for both mesons. Within a Glauber analysis the in-medium omega and eta' widths and the corresponding absorption cross sections have been deduced as a function of the meson momentum. The results are compared to recent theoretical predictions for the in-medium omega width and eta'-N absorption cross sections. The energy dependence of the imaginary part of the omega-and eta'-nucleus optical potential has been extracted. The finer binning of the present data compared to the existing data allows a more reliable extrapolation towards the production threshold. The modulus of the imaginary part of the eta'-nucleus potential is found to be about three times smaller than recently determined values of the real part of the eta'-nucleus potential, which makes the eta' meson a suitable candidate for the search for meson-nucleus bound states. For the. meson, the modulus of the imaginary part near threshold is comparable to the modulus of the real part of the potential. As a consequence, only broad structures can be expected, which makes the observation of omega mesic states very difficult experimentally.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Poly(styrene-block-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) is a model hierarchically nanostructured polymer that contains PEO crystallites within microphase segregated block copolymer morphology. In order to investigate dynamics in this hierarchically nanostructured polymer, water was used as a selective, interacting probe molecule. First, the equilibrium effect of water sorption on the polymer structure was examined. Then, the coupled dynamics of structural changes and water diffusion were studied. At moderate water activity, crystallite dissolution caused water diffusion to appear non-Fickian (determined by Fourier Transform infrared - attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy). PEO deliquescence was so extreme at high water activity that dynamics could not be measured in a homopolymer control. In the block copolymer at unity water activity, a second stage of water sorption occurred that was attributed to relaxation of the glassy PS phase. Water desorption was ten times faster than sorption. Desorption is thought to be less hindered by tortuosity resulting from PEO crystallites. These results are of interest for a wide-range of applications including batteries and fuel cells, water desalination, food packaging, and biomedical implants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "The Southern Ocean (SO) is a major sink for anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), potentially harbouring even greater potential for additional sequestration of CO2 through enhanced phytoplankton productivity. In the SO, primary productivity is primarily driven by bottom up processes (physical and chemical conditions) which are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Due to a paucity of trace metals (such as iron) and high variability in light, much of the SO is characterised by an ecological paradox of high macronutrient concentrations yet uncharacteristically low chlorophyll concentrations. It is expected that with increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the coincident warming, the major physical and chemical process that govern the SO will alter, influencing the biological capacity and functioning of the ecosystem. This review focuses on the SO primary producers and the bottom up processes that underpin their health and productivity. It looks at the major physico-chemical drivers of change in the SO, and based on current physiological knowledge, explores how these changes will likely manifest in phytoplankton, specifically, what are the physiological changes and floristic shifts that are likely to ensue and how this may translate into changes in the carbon sink capacity, net primary productivity and functionality of the SO.

      "Abstract Note" : "The synthesis, structure elucidation, and spectroscopic measurements of a myriad of new, f-element borates has revealed the unusual effects that this electron-rich oxoanion has on the electronic properties of lanthanides and actinides. One purpose of these studies was to provide models for actinide compounds that may exist in either vitrified nuclear waste or in repositories located within salt deposits that have significant borate content. In addition, the radiation-damage resilience of polyborate networks positions these materials as suitable candidates for probing coordination chemistry and physical properties much deeper into the actinide series than is normally possible, and compounds with actinides up to californium (Z=98) have been successfully prepared and characterized in exquisite detail. Structural determination of these materials show that both the lanthanide and actinide series display previously unknown coordination chemistry, but, more importantly, that the two series have little overlap in terms of structure and composition, and have few parallels. In addition, some of these compounds display unique physico-chemical properties, one example of which is the selective trapping of radionuclides. The foremost discovery first identified in actinide borates is that the chemistry of californium represents an onset of unprecedented chemical behavior that compares better with high-oxidation state, early transition metal complexes than it does with earlier f-elements.

      "Abstract Note" : "Introduction: Appropriate neural patterning of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is critical to generate specific neural cells/tissues and even mini-brains that are physiologically relevant to model neurological diseases. However, the capacity of signaling factors that regulate 3-D neural tissue patterning in vitro and differential responses of the resulting neural populations to various biomolecules have not yet been fully understood. Methods: By tuning neural patterning of hiPSCs with small molecules targeting sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, this study generated different 3-D neuronal cultures that were mainly comprised of either cortical glutamatergic neurons or motor neurons. Results: Abundant glutamatergic neurons were observed following the treatment with an antagonist of SHH signaling, cyclopamine, while Islet-1 and HB9-expressing motor neurons were enriched by an SHH agonist, purmorphamine. In neurons derived with different neural patterning factors, whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed similar voltage-gated Na+/K+ currents, depolarization-evoked action potentials and spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents. Moreover, these different neuronal populations exhibited differential responses to three classes of biomolecules, including (1) matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors that affect extracellular matrix remodeling; (2) N-methyl-D-aspartate that induces general neurotoxicity; and (3) amyloid beta (1-42) oligomers that cause neuronal subtype-specific neurotoxicity. Conclusion: This study should advance our understanding of hiPSC self-organization and neural tissue development and provide a transformative approach to establish 3-D models for neurological disease modeling and drug discovery. Statement of Significance Appropriate neural patterning of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is critical to generate specific neural cells, tissues and even mini-brains that are physiologically relevant to model neurological diseases. However, the capability of sonic hedgehog-related small molecules to tune different neuronal subtypes in 3-D differentiation from hiPSCs and the differential cellular responses of region-specific neuronal subtypes to various biomolecules have not been fully investigated. By tuning neural patterning of hiPSCs with small molecules targeting sonic hedgehog signaling, this study provides knowledge on the differential susceptibility of region-specific neuronal subtypes derived from hiPSCs to different biomolecules in extracellular matrix remodeling and neurotoxicity. The findings are significant for understanding 3-D neural patterning of hiPSCs for the applications in brain organoid formation, neurological disease modeling, and drug discovery.

      "Abstract Note" : "BACKGROUND: The mechanistic underpinnings of sex differences in occurrence of depression and efficacy of antidepressant treatments are poorly understood. We examined the effects of isolation stress (IS) and the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine on anhedonia and depression-like behavior, spine density, and synaptic proteins in male and female rats. METHODS: We used a chronic social IS paradigm to test the effects of ketamine (0, 2.5 mg/kg, and 5 mg/kg) on behavior and levels of synaptic proteins synapsin-1, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glutamate receptor 1 in male rats and female rats in diestrus. Medial prefrontal cortex spine density was also examined in male rats and female rats that received ketamine during either the diestrus or the proestrus phase of their estrous cycle. RESULTS: Male rats showed anhedonia and depression-like behavior after 8 weeks of IS, concomitant with decreases in spine density and levels of synapsin-1, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glutamate receptor 1 in the medial prefrontal cortex; these changes were reversed by a single injection of ketamine (5 mg/kg). After 11 weeks of IS, female rats showed depression-like behavior but no signs of anhedonia. Although both doses of ketamine rescued depression-like behavior in female rats, the decline observed in synaptic proteins and spine density in IS and in diestrus female rats could not be reversed by ketamine. Spine density was higher in female rats during proestrus than in diestrus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate a role for synaptic proteins synapsin-1, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glutamate receptor 1 and medial prefrontal cortex spine density in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in male rats subjected to IS but not in female rats subjected to IS, suggesting dissimilar underlying mechanisms for efficacy of ketamine in the two sexes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Middle-Late Ordovician sequences from the Appalachian Basin and Arbuckle Mountain regions of North America were analyzed for carbonate-associated sulfate (delta S-34(CAS)) and pyrite (delta S-34(pyr)) paired with carbonate (delta C-3(carb)) and organic matter (delta C-13(org)) chemostratigraphy. Two major negative drops in delta S-34(CAS) (12%o excursions) are recognized: the older decline in delta S-34(CAS) occurs within the Histiodella holodentata-Phragmodus polonicus Conodont Zones and the younger drop is within the Cahabagnathus sweeti-Ammphognathus tvaerensis (Baltoniodus gerdae subzone) Zones. These overall these negative shifts in delta S-34(CAS) have an antithetical relationship with positive shifts in delta S-34(pyr) (similar to+10 parts per thousand) and delta C-13(carb) (similar to+2 parts per thousand) recorded in the same successions. The older negative delta S-34(CAS) shift is coincident with the widely documented mid-Darriwilian delta C-13 excursion (MDICE), and the younger negative delta S-34(CAS) shift is coincident with another positive delta C-13(carb) shift in the early Sandbian. Geochemical modeling of these sulfur isotope shifts suggests that a decrease in the global rate of pyrite burial or isotope fractionation between seawater sulfate and sedimentary pyrite could account for these negative delta S-13(CAS) trends. Additionally, a substantial increase in the weathering flux of pyrite to the global oceans could also explain these secular sulfur isotope trends. While increased crustal weathering is broadly consistent with a sea-level lowstand, and the seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope record of change in continental weathering in the late Darriwilian Stage of the Ordovician, geologic and geochemical proxy evidence do not support distinct pulses of continental weathering required to generate two separate negative shifts in delta S-34(CAS). These antithetical isotope trends may be best explained by changes in the marine redox state that significantly reduced microbially mediated pyrite burial and organic matter remineralization rates. Pulses of oceanic ventilation would have expanded habitable environments for marine organisms, and thus is broadly consistent with major increases in biodiversification during this period of the Ordovician.

This suggested contrast was erroneous; when areal extents of marine anoxia and euxinia are calculated for both isotopic proxies, the agreement is actually striking, and highlights the fact that large areas of the global ocean probably remained well ventilated during this event.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Chemosensory stimuli from conspecific and heterospecific animals, elicit categorically different immediate-early gene response-patterns in medial amygdala in male hamsters and mice. We previously showed that conspecific signals activate posterior (MeP) as well as anterior medial amygdala (MeA), and especially relevant heterospecific signals such as chemosensory stimuli from potential predators also activate MeP in mice. Other heterospecific chemosignals activate MeA, but not MeP. Here we show that male hamster amygdala responds significantly differentially to different conspecific signals, by activating different proportions of cells of different phenotype, possibly leading to differential activation of downstream circuits. Heterospecific signals that fail to activate MeP do activate GABA-immunoreactive cells in the adjacent caudal main intercalated nucleus (mICNc) and elicit selective suppression of MeP cells bearing GABA-Receptors, suggesting GABA inhibition in MeP by GABAergic cells in mICNc. Overall, work presented here suggests that medial amygdala may discriminate between important conspecific social signals, distinguish them from the social signals of other species and convey that information to brain circuits eliciting appropriate social behavior.

      "Abstract Note" : "The cartilage endplate (CEP) is implicated as the main pathway of nutrient supply to the healthy human intervertebral disc (IVD). In this study, the diffusivities of nutrient/metabolite solutes in healthy CEP were assessed, and further correlated with tissue biochemical composition and structure. The CEPs from non degenerated human IVD were divided into four regions: central, lateral, anterior, and posterior. The diffusivities of glucose and lactate were measured with a custom diffusion cell apparatus under 0%, 10%, and 20% compressive strains. Biochemical assays were conducted to quantify the water and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. The Safranin-O and Ehrlich's hematoxylin and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to reveal the tissue structure of the CEP. Average diffusivities of glucose and lactate in healthy CEP were 2.68 +/- 0.93 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s and 4.52 +/- 1.47 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s, respectively. Solute diffusivities were region-dependent (p < 0.0001) with the highest values in the central region, and mechanical strains impeded solute diffusion in the CEP (p < 0.0001). The solute diffusivities were significantly correlated with the tissue porosities (glucose: p < 0.0001, r=0.581; lactate: p < 0.0001, r=0.534). Histological and SEM studies further revealed that the collagen fibers in healthy CEP are more compacted than those in the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) and show no clear orientation. Compared to human AF and NP, much smaller solute diffusivities in human CEP suggested that it acts as a gateway for solute diffusion through the disc, maintaining the balance of nutritional environment in healthy human disc under mechanical loading and preventing the progression of disc degeneration.

As predicted by escape theory, materialistic individuals may feel dissatisfied with their standard of living, cope with failed expectations and life stressors less effectively than others, suffer from aversive self-awareness, and experience negative emotions as a result. To cope with negative, self-directed emotions, materialistic people may enter a narrow, cognitively deconstructed mindset in order to temporarily blunt the capacity for self-reflection. Cognitive narrowing decreases inhibitions thereby engendering impulsivity, passivity, irrational thought, and disinhibited behaviors, including maladaptive consumption.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Conversion-type materials are an appealing alternative to conventional intercalation compounds as cathode materials for sodium ion batteries, due to their high capacities. In this paper, we report for the first time that carbon-coated copper phosphate (Cu-3(PO4)(2)/C) can be used as a novel high-capacity cathode for rechargeable Na batteries. Cu-3(PO4)(2)/C shows a reversible capacity up to 290 mA h g(-1) at a current of 20 mA g land 190 mA h g(-1) at 400 mA g(-1), with capacity retention of 210 and 160 mA h g(-1) respectively after 30 cycles. The detailed sodium storage mechanisms were studied by employing ex-situ XRD, HR-TEM, solid-state NMR and XAFS techniques. The results clearly indicate that Cu-3(PO4)(2) can transform into Na3PO4 and Cu particles after discharge. Furthermore, Cu can react with Na3PO4 to form copper phosphate and NaxCuyPO4 in the charge process, determining the rechargeability of Cu-3(PO4)(2). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These generalized plane waves exist only in optical structures that are composed of gain and loss (in both linear and nonlinear domains). In the framework of coupled mode theory, we examine the properties of such supermodes in finite waveguide lattices. In particular, CI-supermodes with periodic, localized, and disordered phases in finite chains of optical elements are considered in detail. Extensions to the nonlinear regime and the connection to the continuum limit are also studied.",

Devices fabricated with ZnO show a different memory effect at different current compliances such as WORM at 100 mu A, 500 mu A, and 1 mA, resistive switching (RS) instead of WORM at 5 and 10 mA, and WORM and RS coexisting at 20, 50, and 100 mA, while devices fabricated with ZnO/MgO show WORM only at all current compliances. A few nanometers of MgO layer play a major role in preventing devices from reset at all current compliances because the much lower drift velocity of oxygen vacancy in MgO and accumulation of negatively charged O2- ions at the interface between ZnO and MgO prevent the conducting filaments composed of oxygen vacancies from breaking.",

In particular, we attempt to determine (1) whether competition can be induced among prospective sellers, (2) whether or not competition increases aggregation rates, and (3) what effects competition has on the distribution of surplus among the bargaining parties. We also study the incidence with which a buyer (endogenously) chooses to deal with a single \"large parcel\" owner vs. multiple \"small parcel\" owners. To do so, we make use of a laboratory experiment where all the relevant information about the project is common knowledge and landowner valuations are private information. Our results show that competition more than doubles aggregation rates, with aggregation rates of approximately 40% in the baseline, and at least 84% in the competitive treatments. We also find that developers have a strong preference to make transactions with landowners who have consolidated land holdings, doing so in 24/27 successful aggregations, providing empirical evidence that there is a link between the transactions cost associated with land-assembly and suburbanization, as suggested by Miceli and Sirmans (2007).

We use data from the National Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence (STRiV) (n = 728), a comprehensive national household survey dedicated specifically to the topic of adolescent relationship abuse, to examine associations between requests for money lending, economic control/influence, financial socialization and adolescent relationship abuse among a large, diverse sample of male and female adolescents [48 % female; 30 % non-White, including Black (10 %), Hispanic (2 %), and other (18 %)]. Findings suggest that requests for money lending are associated with heightened risk of moderate and serious threats/physical violence perpetration and victimization, net of traditional predictors.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Although pain severity is often related to poorer mental health and is one of the most common presenting complaints in community health care settings, there is little understanding of the pain experience in relation to anxiety/depressive symptoms and disorders among Latino populations in medical contexts. Method: To address this gap, the current study explored an interactive model of pain severity and emotion dysregulation in relation to anxiety/depressive symptoms and psychopathology among 274 Latinos who attended a community-based primary health care clinic [86.9% female; M-age = 39.3 (SD = 11.2); 96.0% indicated Spanish as their first language]. Results: Results indicated a statistically significant interaction between pain severity and emotion dysregulation for suicidal symptoms, social anxiety symptoms and number of mood/anxiety disorders, such that more severe pain and greater levels of emotion dysregulation related to poorer mental health. Both pain severity and emotion dysregulation were significant predictors of depressive symptoms, but only pain severity was a significant predictor of anxious arousal symptoms. Conclusions: These novel findings suggest a clinically significant interplay between pain severity and emotion dysregulation among Latinos in. The results are discussed in relation to the need for new screening and intervention tactics that address interrelations between pain severity and emotional dysregulation among Latinos seeking treatment in community health-care-based settings.

      "Abstract Note" : "FEM simulations of orthogonal cutting are reported in which both the Johnson Cook (JC) constitutive relation and the Johnson Cook separation (fracture or damage) criterion are used. Results demonstrate that the damaged regions, in which separation of material occurs at the tool tip, form thin boundary layers on the top of the machined surface and on the underside of the chip. Damage was calculated in terms of the parameters of the Johnson Cook fracture criterion appropriate for A2024-T351 aluminium alloy. The size of the damaged layers is some 35 mu m and appears to be independent of the uncut chip thickness to over the range investigated (50 < t(0) < 500 mu m). In most cases, the highly-damaged boundary layers make up only a very small proportion of the uncut chip thickness, so the deformation fields by which chips are formed are essentially the same as if the damage zone were absent. The result explains the success of variables-separable algebraic models of cutting with continuous chips in which the component works of chip plasticity, friction and separation are uncoupled. The FEM simulations predict quasi-linear relations between cutting force and uncut chip thickness, with an intercept on the force axis. This is exactly what is found experimentally and is predicted by algebraic models of continuous chip cutting under the assumption of sharp tool tip, where the slope of the plot relates to the yield stress of the workpiece and the intercept to its fracture toughness. The fracture toughness and the parameters of the JC damage relation, along with the size of the boundary layers of damage, are shown to be related. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Continuing gender disparities within the medical profession have raised concerns about the extent to which women physicians face an inhospitable work environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the types and frequency of workplace bullying reported by a national sample of family physicians employed in academic settings, as related to gender. Material and Methods: Data for this study were gathered as part of the Council of Academic Family Medicine (CAMF) Educational Research Alliance (CERA) omnibus electronic survey. Respondents completed questions addressing sociodemographic and practice characteristics, general experience with bullying, types of bullying, actions in response to bullying, and outcomes. A total of 1065 academic family physicians (male = 56.8%; female = 43.2%), mostly non-Hispanic white (84.2%) or Asian (5.3%) and between the ages 30 and 60 (58.7%) completed the CERA survey. Results: One in 10 respondents acknowledged bullying someone in the workplace; 30% had been personally bullied in the workplace. Conclusions: Compared to men, female physicians were more likely to report being bullied overall and, specifically, to experience having their opinions ignored, lack of recognition for good work, feeling pressured not to claim rightful benefits, and being given unmanageable workloads. Despite some gender differences in actions taken, outcomes for each kind of action were the same for men and women.",

      "Abstract Note" : "One of the major challenges towards controlling the transfer of electrical and mechanical properties of nanotubes into nanocomposites is the lack of adequate measurement systems to quantify the variations in bulk properties while the nanotubes were used as the reinforcement material. In this study, we conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on thickness and conductivity measurements. By analyzing the data collected from both experienced and inexperienced operators, we found some operation details users might overlook that resulted in variations, since conductivity measurements of CNT thin films are very sensitive to thickness measurements. In addition, we demonstrated how issues in measurements damaged samples and limited the number of replications resulting in large variations in the electrical conductivity measurement results. Based on this study, we proposed a faster, more reliable approach to measure the thickness of CNT thin films that operators can follow to make these measurement processes less dependent on operator skills.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Due to time constraints experienced by clinical staff in the hospital environment, traditional methods of educating and disseminating information about new services and treatments, for example music therapy, are often difficult and cumbersome. Social media blogs are emerging as a preferred option for healthcare professionals when needing to disseminate updated clinical and research information in a timely manner. The purpose of this pilot study was to gain information about the effect of a music therapy blog on (1) awareness of NICU music therapy services, and (2) usefulness of the blog as an information source for primary care givers working in a neonatal intensive care unit. Participants included 12 primary care physicians and practitioners working in a level three neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a large tertiary care facility in the South Eastern United States. Participants were randomized to two groups; group A received an email stimulus intervention for the first two weeks of the study while group B received the stimulus the last two weeks of the study. Results showed that there were significant results between the mid/post-test and pre/post-test for group A, but not for group B suggesting that the stimulus intervention helped motivate group A participants to visit the blog site even without the stimulus intervention the last two weeks of the study. Both groups reported high scores for the usefulness of the blog for acquiring information about NICU music therapy services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

It also plays a pivotal role in the pricing of Asian options in mathematical finance. In this paper, we study the probability distributions of the infinite sum of geometric Brownian motions, the sum of geometric Brownian motions with geometric stopping time, and the finite sum of the geometric Brownian motions. These results are extended to the discrete sum of the exponential Levy process. We derive tail asymptotics and compute numerically the asymptotic distribution function. We compare the results against the known results for the continuous time integral of the geometric Brownian motion up to an exponentially distributed time. The results are illustrated with numerical examples for life annuities with discrete payments, and Asian options. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between perceived organizational support (POS) and dominant cultural orientation (DCO), sociocultural adjustment (SCA), job satisfaction US), life satisfaction (LS), and turnover intention (TI) of migrant workers. This research uses a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method with a dual incentive system to attain hard-to-reach migrant employees. The findings demonstrate that both POS and DCO have a significant and positive relationship with SCA and, interestingly, that POS has a stronger impact on hospitality migrants' SCA than DCO. The findings also imply that although personal efforts of migrant workers are important for their effective socialization, positive support from a hospitality organization plays a far more important role. Furthermore, this study highlights the significant relationships between POS and JS and between DCO and LS. The findings also show that SCA had a significant and positive effect on LS and that hospitality migrants who adjust well in their host society tend to have a high satisfaction with their lives in the foreign country and are apt to stay longer in their positions.

Based on information processing theory, this research proposes that variations in the processing fluency of a sustainability message will interact with the cognitive perception of the hotel's destination (NBT versus urban) to affect the perception of the message and the attitude toward the hotel. Results suggest that under conditions of low fluency, consumers are less skeptical of messages presented by hotels in NBT destinations than of similar messages presented by hotels in urban tourism destinations. Low fluency messages also generate more positive attitudes toward NBT destinations than toward urban destinations. These results suggest that the most effective sustainability messages depend not only on the presentation of the message, but also on the type of the destination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "We review recent progress in point contact spectroscopy (PCS) to extract spectroscopic information out of correlated electron materials, with the emphasis on non-superconducting states. PCS has been used to detect bosonic excitations in normal metals, where signatures (e.g. phonons) are usually less than 1% of the measured conductance. In the superconducting state, point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) has been widely used to study properties of the superconducting gap in various superconductors. It has been well-recognized that the corresponding conductance can be accurately fitted by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory in which the AR occurring near the point contact junction is modeled by three parameters; the superconducting gap, the quasiparticle scattering rate, and a dimensionless parameter, Z, describing the strength of the potential barrier at the junction. AR can be as large as 100% of the background conductance, and only arises in the case of superconductors. In the last decade, there have been more and more experimental results suggesting that the point contact conductance could reveal new features associated with the unusual single electron dynamics in non-superconducting states, shedding a new light on exploring the nature of the competing phases in correlated materials. To correctly interpret these new features, it is crucial to re-examine the modeling of the point contact junctions, the formalism used to describe the single electron dynamics particularly in point contact spectroscopy, and the physical quantity that should be computed to understand the conductance. We will summarize the theories for point contact spectroscopy developed from different approaches and highlight these conceptual differences distinguishing point contact spectroscopy from tunneling-based probes. Moreover, we will show how the Schwinger-Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh (SKBK) formalism together with the appropriate modeling of the nano-scale point contacts randomly distributed across the junction leads to the conclusion that the point contact conductance is proportional to the effective density of states, a physical quantity that can be computed if the electron self energy is known. The experimental data on iron based superconductors and heavy fermion compounds will be analyzed in this framework. These recent developments have extended the applicability of point contact spectroscopy to correlated materials, which will help us achieve a deeper understanding of the single electron dynamics in strongly correlated systems.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Within the field of ocean science there is a long history of using controlled vocabularies and other Semantic Web techniques to provide a common and easily exchanged description of datasets. As an activity within the European Union, United States, Australian-funded project \"Ocean Data Interoperability Platform\", a workshop took place in June 2014 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to further the use of these Semantic Web techniques with the aim of producing a set Linked Data publication patterns which describe many parts of a marine science dataset. During the workshop, a Semantic Web development methodology was followed which promoted the use of a team with mixed skills (computer, data and marine science experts) to rapidly prototype a model ontology which could be iterated in the future. In this paper we outline the methodology employed in the workshop, and examine both the technical and sociological outcomes of a workshop of this kind.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Non-salient permanent magnet machines are considered poor candidates for flux weakening operations due to their inherent low-inductance characteristics. In this paper, a two-pole 24-slot non-salient PM machine design is proposed that can utilize a winding switching technique to achieve wide speed range operation. A very wide speed range operation (from 3 to 1 ratio to as much as 13 to 1) is demonstrated. This is accomplished by simply rearranging the winding coils on the stator periphery. Moreover, a control strategy is proposed that not only utilizes the flux weakening using winding switching, but also flux weakening using a negative d-axis current to maximize the speed range of the machine. The machine is operated with two inverters to control the current in the machine winding over the entire speed range. A dq model for the machine is also presented. Analytical, simulated, and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed machine drive system.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Initial access to school is nearly universal in Kenya, but many children who enroll drop out before completing primary school. In this mixed-methods study, we use quantitative data from a randomized control trial involving 2666 upper primary-grade students, as well as qualitative data from interviews with 41 schoolchildren, dropouts, and parents, to examine dropout. Poorer baseline performance on literacy and numeracy assessments predicted a higher risk of dropout. Interviews revealed that children are the primary decision-makers rather than parents. Together, these findings suggest that school quality interventions may be an effective means of reducing primary school dropout in this region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Suggestions from structural symbolic interactionism are that gender role attitudes are malleable-able to change and be redefined over the course of adult development-at the individual-level, particularly in relation to significant experiences. Using longitudinal growth modeling, this study examined how divorce and remarriage affect gender role attitude growth across a 20-year period (N = 1731). Remaining in a first marriage was related to a slight, but significant decline in traditional attitudes. Divorce was associated with a slight acceleration in the decline in traditional attitudes, while remarriage was associated with a slower rate of decline in traditional attitudes. As such, transitions out of the institution and roles of marriage were related to more egalitarian attitudes, but transitions into remarriage were associated with attitudinal shifts similar to those in first marriage. Evidence is also presented related to the possibility that attitudinal shifts toward more egalitarian may precipitate divorce for some. Implications for theoretical refinement are given.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Many bridge management systems (BMSs) use a Markov chain model to forecast the deterioration process. The Markov property may be considered to be restrictive when modeling the deterioration of transportation assets, primarily because of the memoryless property and assumption of exponential distribution for sojourn times in the condition states. This study addresses some of the limitations that arise from the use of purely Markov chain deterioration models for transportation infrastructure by introducing alternative approaches that are based on the semi-Markov process. Two semi-Markov approaches for modeling the deterioration of certain bridge elements are developed. These are compared against a previously developed semi-Markov approach, the traditional Markov chain deterioration approach, and the change in the average actual condition indices of bridge elements that deteriorated for 8years after being constructed. The results obtained from this study indicated that semi-Markov models are feasible and more flexible than the traditional Markov chain models when forecasting the future deterioration of transportation infrastructure. The semi-Markov models that were developed produced condition indices that were closer to the values of the average actual condition indices of bridge elements when compared against the values based on the traditional Markov chain model.",

We clarify that communities are taking a low-regrets incremental approach with increasingly progressive measures motivated by confidence in planning intelligence and direct experience with impacts attributable to sea level rise.",

Construal Level Theory suggests that such distrust can be partially understood in terms of psychological distance, and that reducing psychological distance using simple website tactics should overcome distrust and encourage first-time purchases. Studies 1 and 2 show a physically distant retail store, or lack of a physical store altogether, contribute to psychological distance, distrust, and reluctance to purchase online. Studies 2 and 3 further show that website images of an office building (increased tangibility), or the owner's name and appearance (social proximity), can improve trust and purchase intentions by specifically reducing the psychological distance otherwise associated with purely virtual or physically distant retailers.

      "Abstract Note" : "Andy Warhol was being an asshole. At least Ron Whyte thought so when the two artists crossed paths at a Soho gallery opening in the early 1970s. It's unclear what offense Warhol committed, another incident whose details have been lost to the historical record. But if Warhol had not behaved badly that fateful evening, Whytea queer and disabled playwrightmight never have removed the cosmetic glove covering his withered left arm and hurled it at the visual artist, enabling the glove to make its own contribution to modern art. The famed artist, Whyte claimed, would go on to copy this assault by prosthesis in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein (1973).",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper we describe a novel approach to the study of individual differences in acquired skilled performance in complex laboratory tasks based on an extension of the methodology of the expert-performance approach (Ericsson & Smith, 1991) to shorter periods of training and practice. In contrast to more traditional approaches that study the average performance of groups of participants, we explored detailed behavioral changes for individual participants across their development on the Space Fortress game. We focused on dramatic individual differences in learning and skill acquisition at the individual level by analyzing the archival game data of several interesting players to uncover the specific structure of their acquired skill. Our analysis revealed that even after maximal values for game-generated subscores were reached, the most skilled participant's behaviors such as his flight path, missile firing, and mine handling continued to be refined and improved (Participant 17 from Boot et al., 2010). We contrasted this participant's behavior with the behavior of several other participants and found striking differences in the structure of their performance, which calls into question the appropriateness of averaging their data. For example, some participants engaged in different control strategies such as \"world wrapping\" or maintaining a finely-tuned circular flight path around the fortress (in contrast to Participant 17's angular flight path). In light of these differences, we raise fundamental questions about how skill acquisition for individual participants should be studied and described. Our data suggest that a detailed analysis of individuals' data is an essential step for generating a general theory of skill acquisition that explains improvement at the group and individual levels.

      "Abstract Note" : "Social scientists regularly rely on population estimates when studying change in small areas over time. Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, as there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own retabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by the National Historical Geographic Information Systems (NHGIS) uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Mercury is an important pollutant that can be transported globally due to its long lifetime in the atmosphere. Atmosphere-surface exchange is a major process affecting the cycling of mercury in the global environment and its impacts on food webs. We investigate the sensitivities of the air-surface exchange, atmospheric transport, and budget of mercury to projected 2000-2050 changes in climate and land use/land cover with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). We find that annual mean Hg(0) dry deposition flux over land could increase by up to 20% in northern mid-latitudes by 2050 due to increased vegetation and foliage density. Climate change can significantly affect both the wet deposition and atmospheric chemistry of mercury. In response to the projected climate change, the annual mean wet deposition flux increases over most continental regions and decreases over most of the mid-latitude and tropical oceans. The annual mean mercury wet deposition flux over northern and southern high latitudes increases by 7% and 8% respectively, largely driven by increases in precipitation there. Surface Hg(0) is predicted to increase generally, because high temperatures decrease Hg(0) oxidation by bromine and high moisture increases aqueous Hg(II) photo reduction. The combined effects of projected changes in climate, land use and land cover increase mercury deposition to the continental biosphere and decrease mercury deposition to the marine biosphere.

      "Abstract Note" : "Individuals at risk for suicide experience periods of emotional, enduring, and vivid thoughts about their death by suicide and frequently report violent daydreams about death. Daydreaming is associated with forgetfulness and memory impairments. However, no studies have examined whether suicidal ideation is associated with deficits in everyday memory capabilities and whether violent daydreaming may influence these relationships. This study tested these hypotheses in a sample of 512 young adults. Self-report measures of subjective everyday memory capabilities, violent daydreaming, and suicidal ideation were administered. Results indicated that suicidal ideation and violent daydreaming were each significantly associated with greater impairments in everyday memory retrieval and everyday memory encoding (i.e., attentional tracking). Furthermore, violent daydreaming accounted for the relationship between suicidal ideation and impairments in everyday memory retrieval and memory encoding. Notably, findings remained after controlling for gender and depressive symptoms, a robust predictor of memory impairments. Implications and limitations are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Thalassemia is a congenital blood disorder which destroys red blood cells at a faster rate than can be produced, resulting in anemia. Historically, this disease is found more often in Old World populations, such as Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian. The earliest reported skeletal evidence of thalassemia comes from the eastern Mediterranean (Atlit-Yam) and is correlated with early agriculturalists' exposure to malarial parasites. While there have been virtually no skeletal reports of thalassemia in prehistoric Native American populations, among the individuals from the 8000-year-old hunter-gatherer site of Windover, Florida there is a single potential case of the disease. A female in her early 20's exhibits bilateral foreshortening of the humeri with indications of premature epiphyseal fusion. Both proximal humeri are medio-laterally compressed, the gleno-humeral joint surfaces exhibit medial deformation, and bones show expansion of the medullary cavity with increased cancellous bone growth. These characteristics have been reported as indicators of thalassemia in both clinical and archaeological contexts. Alternate diagnoses such as congenital dislocation or injuries during child birth are considered but fail to account for the full set of characteristics shown. Individual #76 may, therefore, represent the oldest reported case of thalassemia from a native North American skeletal population. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Quantification of groundwater recharge from precipitation in the huge sand dunes is an issue in accounting for regional water balance in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) where about 100 lakes exist between dunes. In this study, field observations were conducted on a sand dune near a large saline lake in the BJD to investigate soil water movement through a thick vadose zone for groundwater estimation. The hydraulic properties of the soils at the site were determined using in situ experiments and laboratory measurements. A HYDRUS-1D model was built up for simulating the coupling processes of vertical water-vapor movement and heat transport in the desert soil. The model was well calibrated and validated using the site measurements of the soil water and temperature at various depths. Then, the model was applied to simulate the vertical flow across a 3-m-depth soil during a 53-year period under variable climate conditions. The simulated flow rate at the depth is an approximate estimation of groundwater recharge from the precipitation in the desert. It was found that the annual groundwater recharge would be 11-30 mm during 1983-2012, while the annual precipitation varied from 68 to 172 mm in the same period. The recharge rates are significantly higher than those estimated from the previous studies using chemical information. The modeling results highlight the role of the local precipitation as an essential source of groundwater in the BJD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Most research on early identification of reading disabilities has focused on word reading problems and little attention has been given to reading comprehension difficulties. In this study, we investigated whether measures of language ability and/or response to language intervention in kindergarten uniquely predicted reading comprehension difficulties in third grade. A total of 366 children were administered a battery of screening measures at the beginning of kindergarten and progress monitoring probes across the school year. A subset of children also received a 26-week Tier 2 language intervention. Participants' achievement in word reading was assessed at the end of second grade, and their performance in reading comprehension was measured as the end of third grade. Results showed that measures of language ability in kindergarten significantly added to the prediction of reading comprehension difficulties over and above kindergarten word reading predictors and direct measures of word reading in second grade. Response to language intervention also proved to be a unique predictor of reading comprehension outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of their relevance for the early identification of reading disabilities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Nanocrystalline TiO2 and MWCNTs are important functional materials that have received considerable research interest in the last few decade. In this work, the composites of TiO2 nanoparticles with varying amount of functionalized MWCNTs were prepared by using a solution-based method. The physicochemical properties of these composites were studied in connection with their antibacterial activity. TiO2 particles have non-spherical shape with size in the range of 8-15 nm; which were confirmed through TEM analysis and these particles were well hosted on the surface of MWCNTs. The tuning of optical band gap of nanocomposites was studied by using DR UV-visible spectroscopy. The photocatalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using TiO2-MWCNTs nanocomposites in the presence of visible light (X >420 nm) has been carried out. These nanocomposites show efficient antibacterial activity under visible light illumination, whereas bare TiO2 nanoparticles did not show any inhibitory effect on bacteria under visible light exposure. These results suggest that UV light or TiO2 alone is not effective for photocatalytic disinfection applications. Also, cytotoxicity study reveals that the nanocomposites show better cell viability than bare TiO2 nanoparticles. Overall, the experimental results suggest that TiO2-MWCNTs nanocomposites have been developed as efficient antibacterial agents against a wide range of microorganisms to prevent and control the persistence and spreading of bacterial infections.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Suicide is a major public health concern in military and civilian contexts. Veteran populations are at increased risk for suicide, especially veterans with mental health disorders such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Suicidal ideation (SI) is a primary risk factor for suicide. Methods: We investigated changes in SI in a multi-site sample of treatment seeking veterans from three separate Veterans Health Administration (VA) medical centers (n = 289) who received Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD. SI and PTSD symptoms were assessed, using self-report instruments, throughout routine clinical care. Results: Both PTSD and SI symptoms reduced over the course of treatment (d-type effect sizes of 1.47 and 0.27, respectively). While SI was associated with PTSD symptoms at all time points, appropriately specified, time lagged models indicated that changes in PTSD symptoms were predictive of future declines in SI, while the converse was not true. Conclusions: Results indicate that treating PTSD symptoms with an EBT for PTSD can be an effective way to reduce SI, at least partially, and for some patients. These data are significant in light of the resources and programming devoted to addressing SI in the VA relative to available empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of developed strategies. The findings demonstrate the importance of facilitating EBT referrals for specific disorders as a component of broad-based suicide outreach and preventions strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) is a newly proposed diagnostic entity that characterizes rapid onset suicidal intent. This study aims to confirm the factor structure of ASAD among psychiatric inpatients, and to determine the clinical utility of ASAD in predicting suicide attempt status. Overall,1442 psychiatric inpatients completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms theorized to comprise the ASAD construct. Utilizing these data, a confirmatory factor analysis with a one-factor solution was performed. Regression analyses were employed to determine if the ASAD construct predicted past suicide attempts, and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were employed to determine if ASAD symptoms differed by the presence and number of past suicide attempts. The one-factor solution indicated good fit: chi(2)(77) = 309.1, p < 0.001, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.96, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.97, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05. Controlling for depressive disorders and current symptoms, the ASAD construct significantly predicted the presence of a past suicide attempt. Moreover, ASAD differentiated in the expected directions between individuals with a history of multiple suicide attempts, individuals with a single suicide attempt, and individuals with no history of a suicide attempt. Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD) appears to be a unified construct that predicts suicidal behavior and is distinct from an already-defined mood disorder. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts have become an acceptable prosthetic alternative to autologous vein for infrainguinal arterial reconstructions. Recently, heparin bonding to the graft's luminal surface has been used as an adjunctive method of improving graft patency. We retrospectively evaluated a prospective experience with heparin-bonded ePTFE (HePTFE) vs the results of a prior experience with standard ePTFE (SePTFE) to compare patency rates in above-knee (AK) and below-knee (BK) femoropopliteal bypass through the 5-year follow-up. Methods: Prosthetic femoropopliteal bypasses performed by our four-surgeon group were constructed using 6-mm SePTFE grafts before August 2007. Subsequently, all such bypasses were constructed using 6-mm HePTFE (Propaten graft; W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz). The surgical technique used in all cases throughout the study was similar irrespective of surgeon or graft material. Loss of primary patency was defined by graft thrombosis; duplex scan confirmed graft failure. Descriptive estimation of patency rates was carried out using standard Kaplane-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze relationships between predictors and time to loss of patency. Results: There were 192 AK (87 Propaten, 105 SePTFE) and 60 BK (42 Propaten, 18 SePTFE) grafts. Overall primary patency for Propaten was statistically better than SePTFE at years 1 (93.6% vs 84.2%), 2 (79.7% vs 73.8%), 3 (79.7% vs 69.5%), 4 (74.5% vs 59.9%) and 5 (74.5% vs 56.2%; log-rank test, P = .036). Five-year primary patency was superior for Propaten AK grafts (85.2% vs 59.3%; log-rank test, P = .028) and for Propaten BK grafts (59.6% vs 0.0/undeterminable; log-rank test, P = .016). Variables significantly associated with loss of patency for Propaten and SePTFE were claudication (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41), age (HR, 0.95), isolated popliteal artery (HR, 3.1-4.4), and ankle-brachial index after the procedure (HR, 0.10). Controlling for conduit effect, clopidogrel use did not significantly affect patency (P = .076). No grafts were associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: These data show that the Propaten HePTFE graft offered significantly better long-term patency over the SePTFE graft, suggesting Propaten as the prosthetic graft of choice for bypasses to the femoropopliteal artery when autologous vein is unavailable or inappropriate.",

We argue that apprehension about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian contributes to contagion concerns. We hypothesized that exposing heterosexuals to others' nonprejudiced attitudes would reduce their contagion concerns. Consistent with these predictions, perceptions of peer prejudice statistically predicted contagion concerns, over and above personal prejudice (Study 1). In addition, participants exposed to a nonprejudiced versus a high-prejudiced norm (or control condition) expressed lower contagion concerns and less anxious/avoidant responses toward gay men/lesbians (Studies 2 and 4). Finally, exposure to fellow students' nonprejudiced views resulted in lower contagion concerns than a control group (Study 3) due to decreased concerns about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian (Study 4). These results provide evidence that changing perceptions of others' prejudice can reduce contagion concerns.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Aim: Consistency, both in duration and behavior, of pre-performance routines has been closely related to overall performance quality. However, recent findings highlight that psychological and physiological states may have important implications for routine consistency. To further clarify this relationship, the present study sought to examine changes in routine consistency with respect to optimal and non optimal arousal states. Method: The present case study observed the performance routines of three high-skilled golfers during three rounds of competitive golf. Measures of arousal (heart rate) and outcome performance were used to determine each golfer's Individual Arousal-related Performance Zones (IAPZs) (Kamata, Hanin, & Tenenbaum, 2002). Subsequently, temporal and behavioral patterns (consistency and number of rehearsal swings and glances toward the target) for both the full swing and golf putt were assessed across poor, moderate, and optimal levels of the golfer's IAPZ. Results: Idiosyncratic differences in routine patterns, both behaviorally and temporally were evident. More importantly, the consistency of the routines for each golfer varied under different arousal-related performance zones. That is, the temporal and behavioral patterns of the golfers varied in idiosyncratic ways across the IAPZ levels. Conclusions: These findings suggest that factors that influence a performer's arousal level can lead to idiosyncratic variations in a performer's routine. Observation of these routine changes can provide insight into the negative tendencies that an athlete can have when performing outside their optimal zone. With this knowledge, practitioners can be more effective in helping athletes monitor and regulate arousal, which will ultimately lead to enhanced performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "Phenotypes frequently vary across and within species. The connection between specific phenotypic effects and function, however, is less understood despite being essential to our understanding of the adaptive process. Snake venoms are ideal for identifying functionally important phenotypic variation because venom variation is common, and venoms can be functionally characterized through simple assays and toxicity measurements. Previous work with the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) used multivariate statistical approaches to identify six unique venom phenotypes. We functionally characterized hemolytic, gelatinase, fibrinogenolytic, and coagulant activity for all six phenotypes, as well as one additional venom, to determine if the statistically significant differences in toxin expression levels previously documented corresponded to differences in venom activity. In general, statistical differences in toxin expression predicted the identified functional differences, or lack thereof, in toxic activity, demonstrating that the statistical approach used to characterize C. adamanteus venoms was a fair representation of biologically meaningful differences. Minor differences in activity not accounted for by the statistical model may be the result of amino-acid differences and/or post translational modifications, but overall we were able to link variation in protein expression levels to variation in function as predicted by multivariate statistical approaches.

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: Prior research suggests that neighborhood context has an important role in shaping individuals' generalized trust, which is an important ingredient in establishing social capital and collective efficacy. Because most of the empirical research focuses on the direct effects of neighborhood conditions such as disadvantage and disorder, there is a rather limited understanding of how social mechanisms affect individual levels of trust. As a result, it remains unclear whether several theoretically relevant social processes mediate the effect of neighborhood disorder. Methods: Using data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Community Survey (PHDCN-CS), multilevel mediation modeling is used to investigate whether social mechanisms, specifically fear and negative police efficacy, mediate the relationship between neighborhood disorder and individual level generalized trust. Results: Our results show that neighborhood disorder reduces generalized trust and that fear and negative perceptions of police efficacy mediate the effects of neighborhood disorder. Conclusions: Social mechanisms, specifically fear and negative police efficacy, are salient processes in the neighborhood disorder and generalized trust relationship. Theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: To evaluate Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) spuriousness thesis by focusing on the virtue of alternative psychologically based constructs in explaining substance use, offending and victimization beyond low self-control. Methods: Data from several hundred young adults were analyzed using structural equation modeling to evaluate the argument that personality traits are immaterial to explaining malignant behaviors beyond low self-control. To achieve this, the Dark Triad of personality was introduced in models alongside low self-control to explain the varied outcomes. Results: Structural equation modeling demonstrated that those with low self-control are more likely to engage in substance abuse whereas those exhibiting Dark Triad traits were not. Low self-control and the Dark Triad independently predicted criminal offending, but only the Dark Triad predicted victimization, controlling for low self-control. Conclusions: The spuriousness thesis was not supported in this research. Specifically, the contention that alternative personality traits beyond low self-control bear no virtue in explaining crime or victimization was challenged by this work. The Dark Triad of personality is a promising constellation of personality traits linked to crime and victimization that criminologists can exploit to inform further research and theory.

      "Abstract Note" : "Rose rosette virus (RRV), belonging to the genus Emaravirus, is a highly destructive pathogen that causes rose rosette disease. The disease is a major concern for the rose industry in the U.S. due to the lack of highly sensitive methods for early detection of RRV. This is critical, as early identification of the infected plants and eradication is necessary in minimizing the risks associated with the spread of the disease. A highly reliable, specific and sensitive detection assay is thus required to test and confirm the presence of RRV in suspected plant samples. In this study a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of RRV from infected roses, utilizing multiple gene targets. Four pairs of primers and probes; two of them (RRV_2-1 and RRV_2-2) based on the consensus sequences of the glycoprotein gene (RNA2) and the other two (RRV_3-2 and RRV_3-5) based on the nucleocapsid gene (RNA3) were designed. The specificity of the primers and probes was evaluated against other representative viruses infecting roses, belonging to the genera Alfamovirus, Cucumovirus, Ilarvirus, Nepovirus, Tobamovirus, and Tospovirus and one Emaravirus (Wheat mosaic virus). Dilution assays using the in vitro transcripts (spiked with total RNA from healthy plants, and non-spiked) showed that all the primers and probes are highly sensitive in consistently detecting RRV with a detection limit of 1 fg. Testing of the infected plants over a period of time (three times in monthly intervals) indicated high reproducibility, with the primer/probe RRV_3-5 showing 100% positive detection, while RRV_2-1, RRV_2-2 and RRV_3-2 showed 90% positive detection. The developed real-time RT-PCR assay is reliable, highly sensitive, and can be easily used in diagnostic laboratories for testing and confirmation of RRV. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

He also attacks the quality of social work education and research, which he claims has poorly invested government funding and helped create the unmitigated failures of the American child welfare system. However, closer examination reveals that many of his claims, while dramatic, are actually ill conceived and unsupportable.

      "Abstract Note" : "After President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, 26 states filed lawsuits challenging key provisions. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in support of most provisions but held that the mandatory Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional, in effect making it optional for the states. Yet Medicaid expansion is critical if the ACA is to achieve its goal of substantially increasing coverage, especially for lower-income adults with health problems, many of whom are racial and ethnic minorities. This article examines the factors explaining state variation in Medicaid expansion from 2012 to 2014. Although partisan power in the states is a key predictor, other relevant factors include the state's Medicaid policy legacy, providers' influence, conservative ideology, and racial resentment. We demonstrate that the enactment of legislation is only a part of the policy formation process and that implementation is equally salient, with state dynamics playing a critical role.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Pedestrians are considered as one of the most vulnerable road users in less developed countries (LDCs). Yet, pedestrian safety remains poorly addressed in both urban and rural transportation plans in most LDCs. Since most pedestrian injury severity studies are conducted in developed countries, this study fills the gap with an inquiry focused on a highly urbanized region of an LDC that faces a rapid increase in car ownership and increasing pedestrian-related traffic injuries, documenting specific pedestrian safety issues and providing guidance for injury prevention measures in such places. Using the Metro Manila Accident Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS) data from 2008 to 2011, this study combines binomial logistic regression and street level analysis that further explores the statistical results and examines other factors that contribute to collisions and increase the potential for serious injury or death in three cities in Metro Manila: Makati, Manila, and Quezon. The results of the binomial regression analysis show that traffic crashes that involve heavy and multiple vehicles, and an elderly pedestrian (60 years old and above), as well as those that occurred during the evening (7 pm to midnight) and late at night (1 am to 5 am) have significantly higher odds of resulting in a fatal outcome; when the crash involves a female pedestrian and when the road surface is wet the odds of a fatal outcome are lower. Moreover, by closely examining the environment of these roadways, the study finds that most pedestrian fatalities occur on high-speed, high-traffic-volume, multilane roadways, that are surrounded by land uses that generate a particularly problematic mix of heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The street level analysis also finds that fatal pedestrian crashes occur close to different types of transit stations. The results of this study of three cities in Metro Manila, reflect the twofold challenge to pedestrian safety in rapidly urbanizing areas in countries such as the Philippines that are classified as lower-middle-income: they face some of the same pedestrian safety issues as more developed areas, but with a much larger number of pedestrians using the streets, and a built environment that was not planned for the high volume and speed of motor vehicle traffic on today's roadways. Policies and planning that support increased pedestrian safety therefore need to address this dual challenge in the contexts where they are most needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "An early prediction of game theory was that respect for ownership-\"Bourgeois\" or behavior-can arise as an arbitrary convention to avoid costly disputes. However, its mirror image-the dispute-avoiding \"anti-Bourgeois\" or behavior through which owners concede their property to intruders-also corresponds to an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) under the same conditions. It has since been found repeatedly that first finders of valuable resources are frequently left unchallenged in nature, while evidence for ceding property to intruders without a contest is rare at best. An early verbal rationale for the observed rarity of was that two individuals employing such behavior over repeated rounds would be interchanging roles repeatedly, a potentially inefficient outcome known as \"infinite regress.\" This argument was formalized only recently, through a Hawk-Dove model with ownership asymmetry and a fixed probability that two individuals meet again. The analysis showed that if and the cost of fighting exceed thresholds determined by the costs of assuming and relinquishing ownership, then becomes the only stable convention. However, contrary to expectation, and despite the inefficiency of the equilibrium, the analysis also showed that \"infinite regress\" does not invariably render unviable. Nevertheless, this model dealt only with ESSs at which respect for ownership is either absolute or entirely absent. Here, we extend the model to allow for polymorphic evolutionarily stable states, and we use it to explore the conditions that favor partial respect for ownership. In this way, we produce an analytic model that predicts a range of degrees of partial respect for ownership, dependent on model parameters. In particular, we identify a pathway through which any degree of respect for ownership can evolve from absolute disrespect under increasing with increasing costs of fighting.",

Building on Sakaluk's (in this issue) distinction between exploration and confirmation, I argue that this shift will increase correctness of findings, but at the expense of exploration and discovery. The likely effects on the field include aversion to risk, increased difficulty in building careers and hence more capricious hiring and promotion policies, loss of interdisciplinary influence, and rising interest in small, weak findings. Winners (who stand to gain from the mooted changes) include researchers with the patience and requisite resources to assemble large samples; incompetent experimenters; destructive iconoclasts; competing subfields of psychology; and lower-ranked journals, insofar as they publish creative work with small samples. The losers are young researchers; writers of literature reviews and textbooks; flamboyant, creative researchers with lesser levels of patience; and researchers at small colleges. My position is that the field has actually done quite well in recent decades, and improvement should be undertaken as further refinement of a successful approach, in contrast to the Cassandrian view that the field's body of knowledge is hopelessly flawed and radical, revolutionary change is needed. I recommend we retain the exploratory research approach alongside the new, large-sample confirmatory work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.",

However, it remains unclear whether the results flowing from this literature are generalizable to other samples and whether previously observed associations are confounded due to uncontrolled genetic influences. The current study addresses these limitations using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The results of the preliminary models, which do not include controls for genetic influences, produced a pattern of results similar to those previously reported in the extant literature. The results of the genetically informed models revealed that the associations between television viewing and antisocial outcomes are not causal, but rather are driven by uncontrolled genetic influences. Further replication is required, but these findings suggest that results drawn from the extant literature may not be trustworthy.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Half of global wheat production occurs in irrigated cropping regions that face increasing water shortages. In these regions, seasonal forecasts could provide information about in-season climate conditions that could improve resource management, helping to save water and other inputs. However, seasonal forecasts have not been tested in irrigated systems. In this study, we show that seasonal forecasts have the potential to guide crop management decisions in fully irrigated systems (FIS), reduced irrigation systems (supplementary irrigation; SIS), and systems without irrigation (rainfed; RFS) in an arid environment. We found that farmers could gain an additional 2 USD ha(-1) season(-1) in net returns and save up to 26 USD ha(-1) season(-1) in N fertilizer costs with a hypothetical always-correct-season-type-forecast (ACF) in a fully irrigated system compared to simulated optimized N fertilizer applications. In supplementary irrigated systems, an ACF had value when deciding on sowing a crop (plus supplementary irrigation) of up to 65 USD ha(-1) season(-1). In rainfed systems, this value was up to 123 USD ha(-1) when deciding whether or not to sow a crop. In supplementary irrigated and rainfed systems, such value depended on initial soil water conditions. Seasonal forecasts have the potential to assist farmers in irrigated, supplementary irrigated, and rainfed cropping systems to maximize crop profitability. However, forecasts currently available based on Global Circulation Models (GCM) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) need higher forecast skill before such benefits can be fully realized.

      "Abstract Note" : "The recent discovery of active methane venting along the US northern and mid-Atlantic margin represents a new source of global methane not previously accounted for in carbon budgets from this region. However, uncertainty remains as to the origin and history of methane seepage along this tectonically inactive passive margin. Here we present the first isotopic analyses of authigenic carbonates and methanotrophic deep-sea mussels, Bathymodiolus sp., and the first direct constraints on the timing of past methane emission, based on samples collected at the upper slope Baltimore Canyon (similar to 385 m water depth) and deepwater Norfolk (similar to 1600 m) seep fields within the area of newly-discovered venting. The authigenic carbonates at both sites were dominated by aragonite, with an average delta C-13 signature of -47 parts per thousand, a value consistent with microbially driven anaerobic oxidation of methane-rich fluids occurring at or near the sediment-water interface. Authigenic carbonate U and Sr isotope data further support the inference of carbonate precipitation from seawater-derived fluids rather than from formation fluids from deep aquifers. Carbonate stable and radiocarbon (delta C-13 and Delta C-13) isotope values from living Bathymodiolus sp. specimens are lighter than those of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon, highlighting the influence of fossil carbon from methane on carbonate precipitation. U-Th dates on authigenic carbonates suggest seepage at Baltimore Canyon between 14.7 +/- 0.6 ka to 15.7 +/- 1.6 ka, and at the Norfolk seep field between 1.0 +/- 0.7 ka to 3.3 +/- 1.3 ka, providing constraint on the longevity of methane efflux at these sites. The age of the brecciated authigenic carbonates and the occurrence of pockmarks at the Baltimore Canyon upper slope could suggest a link between sediment delivery during Pleistocene sea-level lowstand, accumulation of pore fluid overpressure from sediment compaction, and release of overpressure through subsequent venting. Calculations show that the Baltimore Canyon site probably has not been within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) in the past 20 ka, meaning that in-situ release of methane from dissociating gas hydrate cannot be sustaining the seep. We cannot rule out updip migration of methane from dissociation of gas hydrate that occurs farther down the slope as a source of the venting at Baltimore Canyon, but consider that the history of rapid sediment accumulation and overpressure may play a more important role in methane emissions at this site.

      "Abstract Note" : "Understanding the global redox state of the oceans and its cause-and-effect relationship with periods of widespread organic-carbon deposition is vital to interpretations of Earth's climatic and biotic feedbacks during periods of expanded oceanic oxygen deficiency. Here, we present a compilation of new and published data from an organic-rich locality within the proto-North Atlantic Ocean during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event that shows a dramatic drawdown of redox-sensitive trace elements. Iron geochemistry independently suggests euxinic deposition (i.e., anoxic and sulfidic bottom waters) for the entire section, thus confirming its potential as an archive of global marine metal inventories. In particular, depleted molybdenum (Mo) and vanadium (V) concentrations effectively record the global expansion of euxinic and oxygen-deficient but non-sulfidic waters, respectively. The V drawdown precedes the OAE, fingerprinting an expansion of oxygen deficiency prior to an expansion of euxinia. Molybdenum drawdown, in contrast, is delayed with respect to V and coincides with the onset of OAE2. Parallel lipid biomarker analyses provide evidence for significant and progressive reorganization of marine microbial ecology during the OAE in this region of the proto-North Atlantic, with the smallest relative eukaryotic contributions to total primary production occurring during metal-depleted intervals. This relationship may be related to decreasing supplies of enzymatically important trace elements. Similarly, box modeling suggests that oceanic drawdown of Mo may have approached levels capable of affecting marine nitrogen fixation. Predictions of possible nitrogen stress on eukaryotic production, locally and globally, are consistent with the low observed levels of Mo and a rise in 2-methylhopane index values during the peak of the OAE. At the same time, the environmental challenge presented by low dissolved oxygen and euxinia coincides with increased turnover rates of radiolarian clades, calcareous nanofossils, and foraminifera, suggesting that the temporal patterns of anoxia/euxinia and associated nutrient limitation may have contributed to the fabric of OAE2-related turnover.

A virtual-reality-based learning platform integrating a Kinect-enabled sensorimotor interface was developed and used by twenty three university teaching assistants. Qualitative and quantitative data on the participants' participation behaviors, engagement, and perceptions were collected via video/screen recording; interview, surveys on teaching self-efficacy and sense of presence, and eye tracking. Results indicated that the MILE reinforced sense of presence and supported the performance of an ample range of virtual teaching tasks/actions with avatar-embodied live gesturing. The environmental fidelity in the mixed-reality learning spaces, the design and arrangement of virtual agents and avatars, and the affordance of embodied gesturing and walking are salient MILE design features that affected participants' sense of presence and their virtual teaching performance.

      "Abstract Note" : "To provide insight for nonprofits and for-profits generating synergetic alliance, this study investigates how prior corporate reputation, nonprofit brand familiarity, and fit between company and nonprofit influence supportive CSR outcomes. The study also examines the mediation role of perceived altruism and consumer-company identification in such associations. The results show the significant main effects of corporate reputation, nonprofit familiarity, and company-nonprofit fit on supportive CSR outcomes. More importantly; results show that perceived altruism and the consumer-company identification significantly mediates the influence of a CSR partnership on supportive CSR outcomes. Interestingly, the direct effect of corporate reputation on consumer-company identification was not significant, suggesting that for a company to induce strong identification from consumers, the effects of corporate reputation should be mediated by, its altruistic motives for practicing CSR activities.

      "Abstract Note" : "Trevor Nunn's 1999 Royal National Theatre production of The Merchant of Venice and Dave Chappelle's pixie sketches, produced in 2005 for Comedy Central USA, addressed the same challenge: how does one present ethnic stereotypes in a way that undermines those stereotypes rather than reinforcing them? The different representational strategies adopted by Nunn and Chappelle illustrate the different conventions that govern the representation of ethnicity in high and popular culture. Nunn downplayed the most stereotypical elements of Merchant and guided viewers towards a clear and obvious moral choice. He updated the setting of the play to Weimar Germany, evoking a strong sense of specific social context and prompting the audience to identify with Shylock as the victim of a toxic culture. Chappelle presented a series of hyperbolic racist caricatures that tempted his audience to make the wrong choice. The pixie sketches both solicit and chastise laughter, potentially making viewers aware of their momentary indulgence in the guilty pleasures of bigotry. In Nunn's Merchant, the antidote to racism is empathy, and the audience is reassured of its moral probity; in Chappelle's pixie sketches, the antidote to racism is critical reflection, and audience members are left wondering whether they really should have laughed at Chappelle being called a big-lipped bitch. Reading Merchant through the rough representational logic of the pixie sketches can offer a richer sense of Shakespeare's treatment of ethnic stereotyping than can be found within the conventions of the naturalistic theatre of empathy.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Trauma exposure and smoking co-occur at an alarmingly high rate. However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms underlying this clinically significant relation. The present study examined perceived stress as an explanatory mechanism linking posttraumatic stress symptom severity and smoking-specific avoidance/inflexibility, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and negative affect reduction/negative reinforcement expectancies from smoking among trauma-exposed smokers. Participants were trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking daily cigarette smokers (n = 179; 48.0% female; M-age = 41.17; SD = 12.55). Results indicated that posttraumatic stress symptom severity had an indirect significant effect on each of the dependent variables via perceived stress. The present results provide empirical support that perceived stress may be an underlying mechanism that indirectly explains posttraumatic symptoms relation to smoking-specific avoidance/inflexibility, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and negative affect reduction/negative reinforcement expectancies among trauma-exposed smokers. These findings suggest that there may be clinical utility in targeting perceived stress among trauma-exposed smokers via stress management psychoeducation and skills training. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Three morphological awareness measures, and spelling, word reading, and sentence comprehension tasks were administered to 214 undergraduate college students. Item Response Theory analyses generated a 24-item, validated morphological awareness measure. Path analysis revealed that morphological awareness was a strong predictor of spelling with a standardized path coefficient of .77, and a moderate predictor of word reading and sentence comprehension, with standardized path coefficients of .62 and .58, respectively. Both spelling and word reading were partial mediators of relations between morphological awareness and sentence comprehension. The standardized indirect effect of morphological awareness on sentence comprehension was .38 through spelling and .13 through word reading. A valid morphological awareness measure now exists for use with college students. Morphological awareness is a stronger predictor for spelling than for word reading and sentence comprehension.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Berkelium is positioned at a crucial location in the actinide series between the inherently stable half-filled 5f(7) configuration of curium and the abrupt transition in chemical behavior created by the onset of a metastable divalent state that starts at californium. However, the mere 320-day half-life of berkelium's only available isotope, Bk-249, has hindered in-depth studies of the element's coordination chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis and detailed solid-state and solution-phase characterization of a berkelium coordination complex, Bk(III)tris(dipicolinate), as well as a chemically distinct Bk(III) borate material for comparison. We demonstrate that berkelium's complexation is analogous to that of californium. However, from a range of spectroscopic techniques and quantum mechanical calculations, it is clear that spin-orbit coupling contributes significantly to berkelium's multiconfigurational ground state.",

      "Abstract Note" : "High-efficient and large-scale production of high-quality CNT dispersions is necessary for meeting the future needs to develop various CNT-based electronic devices. Herein, we have designed novel processing protocols by combining conventional ultrasonication process with a new microfluidization technique to produce high-quality SWCNT dispersions with improved processing efficiency. To judge the quality of SWCNT dispersions, one critical factor is the degree of exfoliation, which could be quantified by both geometrical dimension of the exfoliated nanotubes and percentage of individual tubes in a given dispersion. In this paper, the synergistic effect of the combined protocols was systematically investigated through evaluating SWCNT dispersions with newly developed characterization techniques, namely preparative ultracentrifuge method (PUM) and simultaneous Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy (SRSPL). The results of both techniques draw similar conclusions that as compared with either of the processes operated separately, a low-pass microfluidization followed by a reasonable duration of ultrasonication could substantially improve the processing efficiency to produce high-quality SWCNT dispersions with averaged particle length and diameter as small as similar to 600 and similar to 2 nm, respectively.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Temperature variation within a year can impact biological processes driving population abundances. The implications for the ecosystem services these populations provide, including food production from marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures. Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields, but current levels of functional diversity (FD) of targeted species, measured using traits related to species' responses to temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high FD of catch could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8% relative to projections if FD were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast, species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, but that FD can buffer these negative impacts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "One of the more important steps in understanding the ecosystem-level effects of anthropogenic disturbances on resident species is developing an accurate representation of the lethal and sub-lethal effects of these stressors. We develop methods for describing the impacts of oil on growth and mortality rates in fishes. We conducted a literature search to determine potential relationships between direct and indirect effects of exposure to oil, based on the frequency of lesions and body growth reduction. Data examining these effects with different exposure mediums were assessed and then input into four potential response models (a linear, step-wise, hockey stick, and exponential model). We assessed the models using the Akaike Information Criterion. The most parsimonious and best fit model was the hockey-stick. This analysis will aid in identifying where future research on the impact of oil on fish should focus and also aid the development of ecosystem models on impacts of oil spills. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "The fate of carbon stored in permafrost-zone peatlands represents a significant uncertainty in global climate modeling. Given that the breakdown of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often a major pathway for decomposition in peatlands, knowledge of DOM reactivity under different permafrost regimes is critical for determining future climate feedbacks. To explore the effects of permafrost thaw and resultant plant succession on DOM reactivity, we used a combination of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), UV/Vis absorbance, and excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS) to examine the DOM elemental composition and optical properties of 27 pore water samples gathered from various sites along a permafrost thaw sequence in Stordalen Mire, a thawing subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. The presence of dense Sphagnum moss, a feature that is dominant in the intermediate thaw stages, appeared to be the main driver of variation in DOM elemental composition and optical properties at Stordalen. Specifically, DOM from sites with Sphagnum had greater aromaticity, higher average molecular weights, and greater O/C, consistent with a higher abundance of phenolic compounds that likely inhibit decomposition. These compounds are released by Sphagnum and may accumulate due to inhibition of phenol oxidase activity by the acidic pH at these sites. In contrast, sites without Sphagnum, specifically fully-thawed rich fens, had more saturated, more reduced compounds, which were high in N and S. Optical properties at rich fens indicated the presence of microbially-derived DOM, consistent with the higher decomposition rates previously measured at these sites. These results indicate that Sphagnum acts as an inhibitor of rapid decomposition and CH4 release in thawing subarctic peatlands, consistent with lower rates of CO2 and CH4 production previously observed at these sites. However, this inhibitory effect may disappear if Sphagnum-dominated bogs transition to more waterlogged rich fens that contain very little to no living Sphagnum. Release of this inhibition allows for higher levels of microbial activity and potentially greater CH4 release, as has been observed in these fen sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The authors claim that this provides individual-owner privacy and prevents tracking attacks. We show that this protocol falls short of its security objectives, and describe attacks that allow: (a) an eavesdropper to trace a tag, (b) the previous owner to obtain the private information that the tag shares with the new owner, and (c) an adversary that has access to the data stoted on a tag to link this tag to previous interrogations (violating forward secrecy). We analyze the security proof and show that while the first two cases can be addressed with a more careful design, strong privacy remains an open problem for lightweight RFID applications.

We observed several two dimensional (2D) SdH frequencies, whose cross-sectional areas of the Fermi surfaces (FSs) correspond to only a few percent of the first Brillouin zone. Such small 2D FSs are not predicted by band-structure calculations, suggesting that these FS pockets are created by an imperfect nesting of FSs at low temperatures. It is found that the AMRO consists of a long-period oscillation and a short-period one. The long-period oscillation is associated with the Yamaji oscillation corresponding to the a orbit, whose shape and area are consistent with previous magneto-optical measurement. The short-period oscillation is not caused by peaks instead but dips. The dip structure is discussed in terms of the AMRO of a quasi-2D electron system with a periodic potential caused by the possible density-wave related to the ET layers or the 4kF charge-density-wave associated with the TCNQ layers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: There is no definite consensus on the CV burden associated to Masked hypertension (MH) or White Coat Hypertension (WCH) - conditions that can be detected by out-of-office blood pressure measurements (24 hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring, 24 h ABPM). Methods: We investigated the association of WCH and MH with arterial aging, indexed by a range of parameters of large artery structure and function in 2962 subjects, taking no antihypertensive medications, who are participating in a large community-based population of both men and women over a broad age range (14-102 years). Results: The overall prevalence of WCH was 9.5% and was 5.0% for MH, with 54.9% of subjects classified as true normotensive and 30.6% as true hypertensive. Both WCH and MH were associated with a stiffer aorta, a less distensible and thicker common carotid artery, and greater central BP than true normotensive subjects. Notably, the profile of arterial alterations in WCH and MH did not significantly differ from what was observed in true hypertensive subjects. The arterial changes accompanying WCH and MH differed in men and women, with women showing a greater tendency towards concentric remodeling, greater parietal wall stress, and PWV than men. Conclusion: Both WCH, and MH are associated with early arterial aging, and therefore, neither can be regarded as innocent conditions. Future studies are required to establish whether measurement of arterial aging parameters in subjects with WCH or MH will identify subjects at higher risk of CV events and cognitive impairment, who may require more clinical attention and pharmacological intervention.

      "Abstract Note" : "Evaluation of Intellectual Capital (IC) is a vital phenomenon for various organizations in order to determine the value of the organization, to improve the control system and to assist strategic planning and decision-making. This study presents a new model in which the interactions between the IC components are considered in the evaluation and development planning process. This, in turn, would enhance the accuracy in evaluating IC and would aid managers in establishing a development plan for IC. In other words, this study tackles the common problem of the inner correlation between IC components by using fuzzy logic, which bears concrete results. The procedure starts with studying numerous criteria proposed for measuring IC drawn from the literature and selecting the most frequently used ones. Then, the selected criteria are refined through a questionnaire based on their relevance to the organization in which we want to evaluate IC. Interactions among IC criteria are captured with the help of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs). The present study is the first that uses FCMs method for evaluating IC. After the influence of each criterion over the others is identified, several scenarios are developed and analyzed in order to realize their efficiency and effectiveness for IC development. The results reveal that improving IC criteria with maximum influence over others, does not necessarily lead to the development of IC and investigations are required to establish the development plan.

      "Abstract Note" : "High-field magnets require conductors made of Cu-Ag composites that have an exceptional combination of strength and electrical conductivity. Given that increase in strength is generally accompanied by decrease in electrical conductivity, researchers constantly seek the optimum balance between the two. In this paper, we reported the microstructure and properties of Cu-6wt % Ag alloy that had been directionally solidified under a magnetic field (MF) and thermomechanically processed. Thermoelectromagnetic convection by MF changed the mass transportation and diffusion of the melt, thus tilting the growth direction of proeutectic Cu dendrite toward the direction of the heat flow. Applying MF during solidification increased the primary dendrite arm spacing and the presence of supersaturated Ag in proeutectic Cu, but it decreased the volume fraction of the degenerated eutectic component distributed between the proeutectic Cu dendrites. The additional supersaturated Ag increased both the electrical resistivity and the hardness of the alloy. The increase in resistivity occurs because of increased impurity-scattering. The increase in hardness occurs as the result of solid solution strengthening. The precipitation temperature of Ag from Cu was between 275 degrees C and 325 degrees C, and the optimized temperature after aging was about 450 degrees C. After solidifying under MF, rolled Cu-6wt% Ag composite had a lower volume fraction of degenerated eutectic fibers. Thermomechanical processing at 300 degrees C promoted the precipitation of Ag out of the proeutectic Cu and simultaneously enhanced both the microhardness and the electrical conductivity of the alloy.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper, a dimensionless dynamic mathematical model is proposed, in order to analyze the response of single stage absorption refrigeration systems according to operating and geometric parameters. Suitable control volumes are defined in order to obtain the system dynamic response. Mass accumulation in the components is neglected, and the system is divided in two regions: i) the absorbent/refrigerant solution in the thermal compressor, and ii) pure refrigerant in the condenser, expansion valve and evaporator. The temperatures at each control volume are calculated in time with a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the refrigerant side, and with a system of non-linear algebraic equations for the absorbent/refrigerant solution side of the refrigerator. The model equations are based on conservation of mass and energy principles, and simple functions to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of the ammonia-water system. Two sets of experimental data from an absorption refrigeration prototype were used to carry out model adjustment (set 1), followed by experimental validation (set 2), which showed good qualitative and quantitative agreement, within the experimental uncertainties. Dynamic simulations were conducted to assess the adequacy of model assumptions. Since accuracy and low computational time were obtained, it is reasonable to expect that the mathematical model could be used as a reliable design, control and optimization tool for absorption refrigeration systems.

      "Abstract Note" : "Technology policy influences the incentives and opportunities firms have to innovate and adapt to changing environments and thus has important implications for strategy and entrepreneurship. However, to date, strategy and entrepreneurship scholars have paid insufficient attention to technology policy. We underscore the importance of two dimensions of technology policy: (1) state funding for research and (2) state protection of intellectual property (IP). We then illustrate how interactions between these two dimensions of technology policy influence (1) the corporate entrepreneurship (CE) strategies through which firms innovate and adapt and (2) the political strategies through which they attempt to influence and secure the benefits of technology policy. Given differences in the goals, incentives, capabilities, and relative power among the various players affected by technology policy, our discussion contributes to a more thorough understanding of the dynamic interplay between government institutions and firms, the potential complementarity (and substitutions) between firms' CE and political strategies, and interdependent effects of state funding for research and IP protection across different international environments.",

      "Abstract Note" : "As consumer preferences for environmentally conscious products have intensified in recent years, scholars have begun to more deeply explore the complex relationship between green practices and consumer behavior in the hospitality industry. Recently, this stream of research has been extended to the restaurant industry where consumers have become increasingly concerned about corporate social responsibility in general, and sustainable operations in particular. However, while there is general agreement about the importance of promoting a company's sustainability message from a consumer marketing standpoint, an essential underlying question remains unanswered: What is it about sustainability messaging that leads to positive consumer attitudes? The purpose of this research is to explore this question via the complementary theoretical perspectives of construal level theory and information processing theory. Data collected from a sample of restaurant consumers in the United States suggest that consumers process information differently according to variations in the construals of a company's sustainability message. The results indicate that messages congruent with the consumer's perception of sustainability result in a more positive attitude toward the company. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Surprisingly, however, there is a lack of research examining whether intelligence differentially affects the risk for personal victimization. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining whether adolescent levels of verbal intelligence are related to the odds of personal victimization in adolescence and adulthood. This study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The results revealed a statistically significant and consistent association between intelligence and victimization. Persons with lower intelligence were more likely to report being victimized even after controlling for the effects of violent criminal behavior. Future research would benefit by examining more closely the association between IQscore and the risk for victimization over the life course. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "One important aspect of privacy is the ability to securely delete sensitive data from electronic storage in such a way that it cannot be recovered; we call this action secure deletion. Short of physically destroying the entire storage medium, existing software secure-deletion solutions tend to be piecemeal at best - they may only work for one type of storage or file system, may force the user to delete all files instead of selected ones, may require the added complexities of encryption and key storage, may require extensive changes and additions to the computer's operating system or storage firmware, and may not handle system crashes gracefully. We present TrueErase, a holistic secure-deletion framework for individual systems that contain sensitive data. Through design, implementation, verification, and evaluation on both a hard drive and NAND flash, TrueErase shows that it is possible to construct a per-file, secure-deletion framework that can accommodate different storage media and legacy file systems, require limited changes to legacy systems, and handle common crash scenarios. TrueErase can serve as a building block by cryptographic systems that securely delete information by erasing encryption keys. The overhead is dependent on spatial locality, number of sensitive files, and workload (computational-or I/O-bound).",

      "Abstract Note" : "Rates of pregnancy and parenthood among current and former foster youth are two to three times higher than non-foster youth peers. Repeat pregnancies among young mothers aging out of foster care also occur at higher rates than peers not involved with the child welfare system. Furthermore, mothers aging out of foster care demonstrate high levels of parenting stress and risk for child maltreatment. Indeed, this population is in significant need of help; however, beyond anecdotal evidence, little is known about the needs and day-to day experiences of this population. In order to tailor interventions to meet the needs of parents aging out, the perspectives of stakeholders must be taken into account. Using qualitative data gathered from separate small group interviews with parents aging out and service providers, this study examined participants' perceptions of parents' daily experiences, strengths, and needs. Findings indicated that parents aging out face overwhelming adversity and stress with little outside financial, emotional, or parenting support from family or friends. Yet, parents also expressed motivation to be good parents, resilience, and the desire to gain effective parenting skills. Although similar themes arose among parent and provider interviews, perceptions differed. Parents expressed hope and optimism in providing for their children while providers expressed systemic failure in preparing parents for independent living. Based on these findings, we conclude that parenting interventions specific to parents aging out may need to address three fundamental and key components: basic needs, social support, and effective parenting techniques.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the association between agitation and suicidal behavior to synthesize the existing literature (k =13 studies) and point out future directions for research. Results indicated that the association between agitation and suicidal behavior is moderate (Hedge's g = 0.40, p = 0.007, 95% CI [0.08, 0.72]). Follow-up meta-regressions revealed that age, gender, and year of publication were not significant moderators of the magnitude of this relationship. However, there was evidence of publication bias, as shown by a funnel plot and Egger's test. These findings suggest the importance of future research that examines the nature of the association between agitation and suicidal behavior longitudinally and with novel research designs, as implications for clinical practice and suicide risk assessment may be substantial.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: The purpose of this review is to evaluate the peer-reviewed empirical evidence on the use of Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TSY) for the treatment of women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): specifically interpersonal trauma such as intimate partner violence. To date, no such review has been conducted. Methods: Articles meeting study inclusionary criteria were identified through electronic database searches. A total of five studies (N = 5) were selected and reviewed. These studies included two randomized controlled trials (RCT), one follow-up of an RCT, one quasi-experimental study, and one qualitative study. Results: There is tentative evidence to support the efficacy of TSY in reducing PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptomatology for women with PTSD; there is also tentative evidence confirming the feasibility of implementing TSY as an adjunctive mental health intervention, particularly for individuals who are non-responsive to cognitive-based psychotherapies. The qualitative findings speak to a number of benefits of yoga practice stimulated by TSY participation centering on the phenomenon of peaceful embodiment. Conclusions: Replication of these results using larger and more diverse samples and rigorous study designs by independent researchers would add credibility to these findings and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on TSY. Additionally, there is a dearth of studies on this nascent form of therapeutic yoga. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the potential efficacy of TSY with other types of trauma, populations, and settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although numerous studies suggest that religious involvement is associated with a wide range of favorable health outcomes, it is unclear whether this general pattern extends to cellular aging. In this paper, we tested whether leukocyte telomere length varies according to several dimensions of religious involvement. We used cross-sectional data from the Nashville Stress and Health Study (2011-2014), a large probability sample of 1252 black and white adults aged 22 to 69 living in Davidson County, TN, USA. Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction method with albumin as the single-copy reference sequence. Dimensions of religious involvement included religiosity, religious support, and religious coping. Our multivariate analyses showed that religiosity (an index of religious attendance, prayer frequency, and religious identity) was positively associated with leukocyte telomere length, even with adjustments for religious support, religious coping, age, gender, race, education, employment status, income, financial strain, stressful life events, marital status, family support, friend support, depressive symptoms, smoking, heavy drinking, and allostatic load. Unlike religiosity, religious support and religious coping were unrelated to leukocyte telomere length across models. Depressive symptoms, smoking, heavy drinking, and allostatic load failed to explain any of the association between religiosity and telomere length. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to link religious involvement and cellular aging. Although our data suggest that adults who frequently attend religious services, pray with regularity, and consider themselves to be religious tend to exhibit longer telomeres than those who attend and pray less frequently and do not consider themselves to be religious, additional research is needed to establish the mechanisms underlying this association.

      "Abstract Note" : "Affect detection is a key component in intelligent educational interfaces that respond to students' affective states. We use computer vision and machine-learning techniques to detect students' affect from facial expressions (primary channel) and gross body movements (secondary channel) during interactions with an educational physics game. We collected data in the real-world environment of a school computer lab with up to 30 students simultaneously playing the game while moving around, gesturing, and talking to each other. The results were cross-validated at the student level to ensure generalization to new students. Classification accuracies, quantified as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were above chance (AUC of 0.5) for all the affective states observed, namely, boredom (AUC=.610), confusion (AUC=.649), delight (AUC=.867), engagement (AUC=.679), frustration (AUC=.631), and for off-task behavior (AUC=.816). Furthermore, the detectors showed temporal generalizability in that there was less than a 2% decrease in accuracy when tested on data collected from different times of the day and from different days. There was also some evidence of generalizability across ethnicity (as perceived by human coders) and gender, although with a higher degree of variability attributable to differences in affect base rates across subpopulations. In summary, our results demonstrate the feasibility of generalizable video-based detectors of naturalistic affect in a real-world setting, suggesting that the time is ripe for affect-sensitive interventions in educational games and other intelligent interfaces.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Moroccan musicians conflate sacred and popular sounds within diverse and malleable rituals across the country. Their efforts are aimed at negotiating and appeasing their various audiences: clients in need of healing, family and friends looking for an evening of entertainment, and spirits building relationships with possessed bodies. Drawing on ethnographic research from Fez, Meknes and Sidi Ali, I show how gnawa musicians blend the boundaries between ritual and entertainment through musical innovation. Often at the behest of audiences, they perform a contemporary version of the ritual repertoire, adapt dance music rhythms into the ceremony's music and highlight the presence of spirits that are adopted by the gnawa from other traditions. These changes demonstrate pragmatism within ritual that counters common understandings of authentic spiritual practice, blurring lines between religious and secular experience. Professional ritual musicians navigate audience expectations within a contemporary possession healing ritual by adapting their practice, subtly and overtly manipulating the event itself. The resulting innovations illuminate the nexus of listener taste and performer creativity as it influences even the most allegedly conservative musical and religious settings. They show performers reaching out to changing audiences and redefining authentic performance practice within the ritual.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The mechanism of trailing vortex wandering has long been debated and is often attributed to either wind-tunnel effects or an instability. Using particle image velocimetry data obtained in the wake of a NACA0012 airfoil, we remove the effect of wandering from the measured velocity field and, through a triple decomposition, recover the coherent wandering motion. Based on this wandering motion, the most energetic structures are computed using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and exhibit a helical mode with an azimuthal wavenumber of vertical bar m vertical bar = 1 whose kinetic energy grows monotonically in the downstream direction. To investigate the nature of the vortex wandering, we perform a spatial stability analysis of a matched Batchelor vortex. The primary stability mode is found to be marginally stable and nearly identical in both size and structure to the leading POD mode. The strikingly similar structure, coupled with the measured energy growth, supports the proposition that the vortex wandering is the result of an instability. We conclude that the cause of the wandering is the non-zero radial velocity of the vertical bar m vertical bar = 1 mode on the vortex centreline, which acts to transversely displace the trailing vortex, as observed in experiments. However, the marginal nature of the stability mode prevents a definitive conclusion regarding the specific type of instability.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study makes use of the WMO's multimodel data set called THORPEX integrated grand global ensemble (TIGGE) towards the construction of multimodel superensemble forecasts covering a period of 10 days. The goal of this study is to explore the forecast skill for precipitation forecasts over the Greater Horn of Africa (this is a consortium of 11 countries). The multimodels include forecast data set from a suite of models that include: The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies (CPTEC) and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO). After performing a training phase for the superensemble weights covering the previous 450 days of October, November and December months of 2008-2012, forecasts of precipitation were prepared for the multimodel superensemble. These covered day 1 to day 10 of forecasts over the region. Various skill metrics were prepared to validate the forecast rainfall against the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) observed rainfall data. This study shows that the construction of the multimodel superensemble was a worthwhile effort since it provided the best overall skills for the RMS errors, the spatial correlations and the equitable threat scores and their bias errors for precipitation forecasts from day 1 to day 10 over all of the countries covered by the Greater Horn of Africa. The best among the member model was the UKMO model. This study strongly suggests the usefulness of a product such as the multimodel superensemble for improved precipitation forecasts over East Africa.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Introduction: Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often report an unstable sense of self, which is further enhanced in dissociative states. As one consequence, BPD patients show a labile body percept, which might result in a higher degree of body plasticity. However, experimental data on body plasticity in BPD are not yet available. Materials and methods: The rubber hand illusion (RHI) probes the plasticity of one's body by inducing the feeling of ownership for an artificial limb. We tested the proneness to perceive the RHI in female patients with current and remitted BPD compared to healthy controls, and related their perceptions to state and trait dissociation. Results: Participants with current BPD, compared to healthy controls, reported higher proneness to perceive the RHI (p < .05, with an effect size [Cohen's d] of 0.68). Remission was associated with a stabilization of perceptions. RHI vividness was positively related to state and trait dissociation across the groups, and specifically in current BPD when controlling for symptom severity (all Pearson's r >= .30, p < .05). Discussion: These results indicate enhanced body plasticity related to dissociation in BPD, point to shared neurobiological mechanisms, and might help to elucidate the body-related perceptual disturbances associated with BPD. Conclusion: The results provide initial empirical evidence for significant alterations in body ownership processing associated with a current BPD diagnosis, resulting in enhanced body plasticity. Dissociation significantly correlated with illusory limb ownership experiences, making body plasticity a marker for BPD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMUs) are tunable thin films that could serve as coatings for biomedical implants. PEMUs built layer by layer with the polyanion poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) modified with a photosensitive 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) benzophenone (PAABp) group and the polycation poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) are mechanically tunable by UV irradiation, which forms covalent bonds between the layers and increases PEMU stiffness. PAH-terminated PEMUs (PAH-PEMUs) that were uncrosslinked, UV-crosslinked to a uniform stiffness, or UV-crosslinked with an edge mask or through a neutral density optical gradient filter to form continuous compliance gradients were used to investigate how differences in PEMU stiffness affect the adhesion and migration of epithelial cell sheets from scales of the fish Poecilia sphenops (Black Molly) and Carassius auratus (Comet Goldfish). During the progressive collective cell migration, the edge cells (also known as 'leader' cells) in the sheets on softer uncrosslinked PEMUs and less crosslinked regions of the gradient formed more actin filaments and vinculin-containing adherens junctions and focal adhesions than formed in the sheet cells on stiffer PEMUs or glass. During sheet migration, the ratio of edge cell to internal cell (also known as 'follower' cells) motilities were greater on the softer PEMUs than on the stiffer PEMUs or glass, causing tension to develop across the sheet and periods of retraction, during which the edge cells lost adhesion to the substrate and regions of the sheet retracted toward the more adherent internal cell region. These retraction events were inhibited by the myosin II inhibitor Blebbistatin, which reduced the motility velocity ratios to those for sheets on the stiffer PEMUs. Blebbistatin also caused disassembly of actin filaments, reorganization of focal adhesions, increased cell spreading at the leading edge, as well as loss of edge cell-cell connections in epithelial cell sheets on all surfaces. Interestingly, cells throughout the interior region of the sheets on uncrosslinked PEMUs retained their actin and vinculin organization at adherens junctions after treatment with Blebbistatin. Like Blebbistatin, a Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632, promoted loss of cell-cell connections between edge cells, whereas a Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, primarily altered the lamellipodial protrusion in edge cells. Compliance gradient PAH-PEMUs promoted durotaxis of the cell sheets but not of individual keratocytes, demonstrating durotaxis, like plithotaxis, is an emergent property of cell sheet organization.

      "Abstract Note" : "A sedentary lifestyle is harmful for health; personality traits may contribute to physical (in)activity. With participant-level data from 16 samples (N > 125,000), we examined the personality correlates of physical inactivity, frequency of physical activity, and sedentary behavior (in a subset of samples). Lower Neuroticism and higher Conscientiousness were associated with more physical activity and less inactivity and sedentary behavior. Extraversion and Openness were also associated with more physical activity and less inactivity, but these traits were mostly unrelated to specific sedentary behaviors (e.g., TV watching). The results generally did not vary by age or sex. The findings support the notion that the interest, motivational, emotional, and interpersonal processes assessed by five-factor model traits partly shape the individual's engagement in physical activity.

      "Abstract Note" : "The use of self-report surveys for suicide risk screening is a key first step in identifying currently suicidal individuals and connecting them with appropriate follow-up assessment and care. Online methods for suicide risk screening are becoming more common, yet they present a number of complexities compared with traditional methods. This study aimed to assess whether forcing item responses may unintentionally hide or misrepresent otherwise useful missing suicide risk data. We investigated in secondary analyses of 3 independent samples of undergraduates (ns = 1,306; 694; 172) whether participants who chose not to respond specifically to current suicide risk screening items (i.e., Nondisclosers) scored significantly different from other risk response groups (i.e., Deniers, Lower-Risk Endorsers, and Higher-Risk Endorsers) on auxiliary measures related to suicidality. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) tests for each sample revealed that Nondisclosers were rare (ns = 7, 6, 7) and scored significantly higher than Deniers and similarly to Endorsers on suicide risk related measures. In 1 sample, Nondisclosers tended to score higher than all groups on suicide risk related measures. These findings suggest that nondisclosure for suicide risk screening questions is a preferred option for a distinct group of respondents who are likely at elevated suicide risk. Allowing for and flagging Nondisclosers for follow-up suicide risk assessment may be an ethical and feasible way to enhance the sensitivity of online suicide risk screenings for weary respondents, who if forced, may choose to underreport their suicide risk and misrepresent data.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although a suicide attempt history is among the single best predictors of risk for eventual death by suicide, little is known about the extent to which reporting of suicide attempts may vary by assessment type. The current study aimed to investigate the correspondence between suicide attempt history information obtained via a single-item self-report survey, multi-item self-report survey, and face-to-face clinical interview. Data were collected among a high-risk sample of undergraduates (N = 100) who endorsed a past attempt on a single-item prescreening survey. Participants subsequently completed a multi-item self-report survey, which was followed by a face-to-face clinical interview, both of which included additional questions regarding the timing and nature of previous attempts. Even though 100% of participants (n = 100) endorsed a suicide attempt history on the single-item prescreening survey, only 67% (n = 67) reported having made a suicide attempt on the multi-item follow-up survey. After incorporating ancillary information from the in-person interview, 60% of participants qualified for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined suicide attempt. Of the 40% who did not qualify for a CDC-defined suicide attempt, 30% instead qualified for no attempt, 7% an aborted attempt, and 3% an interrupted attempt. These findings suggest that single-item assessments of suicide attempt history may result in the misclassification of prior suicidal behaviors. Given that such assessments are commonly used in research and clinical practice, these results emphasize the importance of utilizing follow-up questions and assessments to improve precision in the characterization and assessment of suicide risk.",

Junctions of sizes on the order of 100 x 100 mu m(2) and barrier thicknesses of 4.4 to 11 angstrom exhibit over 90% reproducibility. The conductance characteristics at low temperature show the clear density of states signature of superconducting Nb. The junction resistance times area product increases exponentially with barrier thickness, further supporting the high quality of the junctions, in which single-step elastic tunneling predominates. The background conductance at low temperature could not be fit with the Brinkman-Dynes-Rowell model, indicating the barriers are not likely to act as a trapezoidal potential. Our work shows that ALD is an effective method in preparing planar tunnel junctions with ultra-thin barriers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Corticotroph cellsfromtheanterior pituitary areanintegral component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which governs the neuroendocrine response to stress. Corticotrophs are electrically excitable and fire spontaneous single-spike action potentials and also display secretagogue-induced bursting behavior. The HPA axis function is dependent on effective negative feedback in which elevated plasma glucocorticoids result in inhibition at the level of both the pituitary and the hypothalamus. In this study, we have used an electrophysiological approach coupled with mathematical modeling to investigate the regulation of spontaneous and CRH/arginine vasopressin-induced activity of corticotrophs by glucocorticoids. We reveal that pretreatment of corticotrophs with 100 nM corticosterone (CORT; 90 and 150 min) reduces spontaneous activity and prevents a transition from spiking to bursting after CRH/arginine vasopressin stimulation. In addition, previous studies have identified a role for large-conductance calcium-and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels in the generation of secretagogue-induced bursting in corticotrophs. Using the dynamic clamp technique, we demonstrated that CRH-induced bursting can be switched to spiking by subtracting a fast BK current, whereas the addition of a fast BK current can induce bursting in CORT-treated cells. In addition, recordings from BK knockout mice (BK-/-) revealed that CORT can also inhibit excitability through BK-independent mechanisms to control spike frequency. Thus, we have established that glucocorticoids can modulate multiple properties of corticotroph electrical excitability through both BK-dependent and BK-independent mechanisms.",

Results of the exploratory latent profile analysis revealed four distinct coping profiles: Disengaged Copers, Troubled Copers, Humor-intensive Copers, and Active Copers. Multinomial logistic regressions found no relationship between military-related stressors (parental separation, frequent relocations, and parental rank) and profile membership. Analysis of variance results revealed significant and meaningful differences between the coping profiles and depressive symptomology, specifically somatic symptoms, depressive affect, positive affect, and interpersonal problems. Post-hoc analyses revealed that Active Copers, the largest profile, reported the fewest depressive symptoms. Accordingly, frequent use of diverse, active coping behaviors was associated with enhanced resilience. Discussion is provided regarding the promotion of adaptive coping behaviors within this developmental period and the context of military family life.

The purpose of this study was to examine how different manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, as measured by different assessment tools, are related to early mathematics skills in preschoolers. Method: Eighty-two preschool children completed a measure of early mathematics and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Teachers rated children's behaviors using the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-15 Item. Sixty-five of these children completed mathematics assessments 1 year later. Results: Teacher ratings of inattention were uniquely related to concurrent early mathematics skills, whereas CPT errors were uniquely predictive of early mathematics skills 1 year later. Conclusion: Findings have implications for the understanding and assessment of behavior problems that are associated with early mathematics difficulties.",

The first three moments (mean, standard deviation and skewness) of sea surface height and surface temperature variability are assessed against observations. Large discrepancies are found in the variance and skewness of sea surface height and in the skewness of sea surface temperature. Comparing with the observation, most models underestimate the Kuroshio transport in the Asian Marginal seas due to the missing influence of the unresolved western boundary current and mesoscale eddies. In terms of the Mixed Layer Depths (MLDs) in the North Pacific, the two observed maxima associated with Subtropical Mode Water and Central Mode Water formation coalesce into a large pool of deep MLDs in all participating models, but another local maximum associated with the formation of Eastern Subtropical Mode Water can be found in all models with different magnitudes. The main model bias of deep MLDs results from excessive Subtropical Mode Water formation due to inaccurate representation of the Kuroshio separation and of the associated excessively warm and salty Kuroshio water. Further water mass analysis shows that the North Pacific Intermediate Water can penetrate southward in most models, but its distribution greatly varies among models depending not only on grid resolution and vertical coordinate but also on the model dynamics. All simulations show overall similar large scale tropical current system, but with differences in the structures of the Equatorial Undercurrent. We also confirm the key role of the meridional gradient of the wind stress curl in driving the equatorial transport, leading to a generally weak North Equatorial Counter Current in all models due to inaccurate CORE-II equatorial wind fields. Most models show a larger interior transport of Pacific subtropical cells than the observation due to the overestimated transport in the Northern Hemisphere likely resulting from the deep pycnocline.

      "Abstract Note" : "PIT and RRP (R) Nb3Sn strands are being developed for high field accelerator magnet upgrades for the high luminosity LHC. Here we report a quantitative study of the shape and position of PIT filaments and RRP (R) sub-elements after rolling lengths of unreacted PIT and RRP (R) round wires to simulate cabling deformation. In the as-drawn condition, filament shape distortion occurs preferentially in the outer ring filaments. By contrast, rolling induces non-uniform shear bands that generate greater distortion of inner ring filaments. By making a full digitization of the shapes of all filaments, we find that a critical distortion occurs for thickness reductions between 10% and 20% when filament shapes in inner filament rings heavily degrade, especially in the vicinity of the strong 45 degrees shear bands imposed by the rolling. It is well known that maintaining diffusion barrier integrity is vital to retaining adequate RRR in the stabilizing copper needed for magnet stability. Diffusion barrier breaks occur preferentially in these distorted inner filaments and drive local Sn leakage during reaction, increasing RRR degradation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "High critical current density (J(c)) Nb3Sn A15 multifilamentary wires require a large volume fraction of small grain (SG), superconducting A15 phase, as well as Cu stabilizer with high Residual Resistance Ratio (RRR) to provide electromagnetic stabilization and protection. In powder-in-tube (PIT) wires the unreacted Nb7.5 wt% Ta outer layer of the tubular filaments acts as a diffusion barrier and protects the interfilamentary Cu stabilizer from Sn contamination. A high RRR requirement generally imposes a restricted A15 reaction heat treatment to prevent localized full reaction of the filament that could allow Sn to reach the Cu. In this study we investigate recent high quality PIT wires that achieve a J(c) (12 T, 4.2 K) up to similar to 2500 A mm(-2) and find that the minimum diffusion barrier thickness decreases as the filament aspect ratio increases from similar to 1 in the inner rings of filaments to 1.3 in the outer filament rings. We found that just 2-3 diffusion barrier breaches can degrade RRR from 300 to 150 or less. Using progressive etching of the Cu we also found that the RRR degradation is localized near the external filaments where deformation is highest. Consequently minimizing filament distortion during strand fabrication is important for reducing RRR degradation. The additional challenge of developing the highest possible J(c) must be addressed by forming the maximum fraction of high J(c) SG A15 and minimizing low J(c) large-grain (LG) A15 morphologies. In one wire we found that 15% of the filaments had a significantly enhanced SG/LG A15 ratio and no residual A15 in the core, a feature that opens a path to substantial J(c) improvement.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Prolactin is an anterior pituitary hormone necessary for fertility, pregnancy maintenance, lactation, and aspects of maternal behavior. In rodents, there is a surge of prolactin on the afternoon of proestrus, and a semi-circadian pattern of prolactin surges during early pregnancy, with a diurnal and nocturnal surge every day. Both of these patterns can be replicated in ovariectomized rats. A prior study demonstrated that central antagonism of kappa-opioid receptors, the target of dynorphin, largely abolished the nocturnal prolactin surge in pregnant rats. We build on this to determine whether dynorphin, perhaps from the arcuate population that co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons), also contributes to the estradiol- or cervical stimulation-induced surges in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomized rats were treated with either estradiol or cervical stimulation to induce prolactin surge(s). Blood samples were taken around the expected surge time to determine the effect of either acute kappa-opioid receptor antagonism or previous chemical ablation of the KNDy population on prolactin levels. Dynorphin antagonism does significantly disrupt the nocturnal prolactin surge, but it does not contribute to the estradiol-induced surge. Chemical ablation of KNDy neurons had opposite effects; ablation of 40 % of the KNDy neurons had no impact on the nocturnal prolactin surge, while a somewhat larger ablation significantly reduced the size of the estradiol-induced surge. We conclude that dynorphin is likely a controlling factor for the nocturnal surge induced by cervical stimulation, and that other KNDy neuron products must play a role in the estradiol-induced surge.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The effect of curved-boundary representation on the physics of the separated flow over a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil is thoroughly investigated. A method is presented to approximate curved boundaries with a high-order discontinuous-Galerkin spectral element method for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Multiblock quadrilateral element meshes are constructed with the grid generation software GridPro. The boundary of a NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil, defined by a cubic natural spline, is piecewise-approximated by isoparametric polynomial interpolants that represent the edges of boundary-fitted elements. Direct numerical simulation of the airfoil is performed on a coarse mesh and fine mesh with polynomial orders ranging from four to twelve. The accuracy of the curve fitting is investigated by comparing the flows computed on curved-sided meshes with those given by straight-sided meshes. Straight-sided meshes yield irregular wakes, whereas curved-sided meshes produce a regular Karman street wake. Straight-sided meshes also produce lower lift and higher viscous drag as compared with curved-sided meshes. When the mesh is refined by reducing the sizes of the elements, the lift decrease and viscous drag increase are less pronounced. The differences in the aerodynamic performance between the straight-sided meshes and the curved-sided meshes are concluded to be the result of artificial surface roughness introduced by the piecewise-linear boundary approximation provided by the straight-sided meshes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper utilizes smartphone sensing of vehicle dynamics to determine driver phone use, which can facilitate many traffic safety applications. Our system uses embedded sensors in smartphones, i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes, to capture differences in centripetal acceleration due to vehicle dynamics. These differences combined with angular speed can determine whether the phone is on the left or right side of the vehicle. Our low infrastructure approach is flexible with different turn sizes and driving speeds. Extensive experiments conducted with two vehicles in two different cities demonstrate that our system is robust to real driving environments. Despite noisy sensor readings from smartphones, our approach can achieve a classification accuracy of over 90 percent with a false positive rate of a few percent. We also find that by combining sensing results in a few turns, we can achieve better accuracy (e.g., 95 percent) with a lower false positive rate. In addition, we seek to exploit the electromagnetic field measurement inside a vehicle to complement vehicle dynamics for driver phone sensing under the scenarios when little vehicle dynamics is present, for example, driving straight on highways or standing at roadsides.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Plenoptic PIV offers a simple, single camera solution for volumetric velocity measurements of fluid flow. However, due to the novel manner in which the particle images are acquired and processed, few references exist to aid in determining the resolution limits of the measurements. This manuscript provides a framework for determining the spatial resolution of plenoptic PIV based on camera design and experimental parameters. This information can then be used to determine the smallest length scales of flows that are observable by plenoptic PIV, the dynamic range of plenoptic PIV, and the corresponding uncertainty in plenoptic PIV measurements. A simplified plenoptic camera is illustrated to provide the reader with a working knowledge of the method in which the light field is recorded. Then, operational considerations are addressed. This includes a derivation of the depth resolution in terms of the design parameters of the camera. Simulated volume reconstructions are presented to validate the derived limits. It is found that, while determining the lateral resolution is relatively straightforward, many factors affect the resolution along the optical axis. These factors are addressed and suggestions are proposed for improving performance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "There are many factors affecting submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). However, systematic study of the influences of these factors is still limited. In this study, numerical modeling is performed to quantitatively explore the influences of various factors on SGD in a coastal aquifer. In such locations, tidal and terrestrial hydraulic gradients are the primary forces driving fresh and salt water movement. Unlike steady-state flow, dynamic fresh and salt water mixing at the near-shore seafloor may form an intertidal mixing zone (IMZ) near the surface. By constructing a general SGD model, the effects of various model components such as boundary conditions, model geometry and hydraulic parameters are systematically studied. Several important findings are obtained from the study results: (1) Previous studies have indicated there will be a freshwater discharge tube between the classic transition zone and the IMZ. However, this phenomenon may become unclear with the increase of heterogeneity and anisotropy of the medium's conductivity field. (2) SGD and IMZ are both more sensitive to the vertical anisotropy ratio of hydraulic conductivity (K-x/K-z) than to the horizontal ratio (K-x/K-y). (3) Heterogeneity of effective porosity significantly affects SGD and IMZ. (4) Increase of the storage coefficient decreases fresh water discharge but increases mixing salt water discharge and total SGD. The increase will also change the shape of the IMZ. (5) Variation of dispersivities does not affect SGD, but significantly changes the distributions of the IMZ and the whole mixing zone. These findings will be helpful to the sampling design of field studies of SGD and to the application of dynamic SGD models to field sites for model development and calibration.",

Coaching parents to implement communication support strategies is increasingly common in parent-implemented interventions, but few studies examine the process as well as the outcomes. We explored the triadic relationships between interventionist, parent, and child within a parent-implemented communication for toddlers with Down syndrome (DS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or developmental delays (DD). Time-window sequential analyses revealed that parents were more likely to use communication strategies during or immediately following coaching strategies that encouraged the parents' active role. Children were more likely to use targeted communication skills immediately following responsive parent interactions. Intervention occurred in similar frequencies across play and non-play routine contexts. This analysis provides preliminary information on understanding potential mediating variables in parent-implemented interventions. Implications for increasing parent capacity-building and child outcomes through coaching are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Incorporating nanostructured functional constituents within polymers has become extensive in processes and products for manufacturing composites. The conception of carbon nanotubes (CNT5) and their heralded attributes that yield property enhancements to the carrier system is leading many industries and research endeavors. Reported Displaced Foam Dispersion (DFD) methodology is a novel and effective approach to facilitating the incorporation of CNTs within fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPC). The methodology consists of six separate solubility phases that lead to the manufacture of CNT-FRPCs. This study was primarily initiated to characterize the interaction parameters of nanomaterials (multi walled carbon nanotubes), polymers (polystyrene), and solvents (dimethyl formamide (DMF) and acetone) in the current paradigm of the DFD materials manufacture. Secondly we sought to illustrate the theoretical potential for the methodology to be used in conjunction with other nanomaterial-polymersolvent systems. Herein, the theory of Hansen's solubility parameters (HSP) is employed to explain the effectiveness of the DFD materials manufacture ratios and aid in the explanation of the experimental results. The results illustrate quantitative values for the relative energy differences between each polymer-solvent system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in each of the solubility stages and culminates with an indication of good dispersion. Additionally, the rate of acetone evaporation over 25 min is reported for the sorbed CNTaffy nanocomposites from 0 to approximately 60 wt percent loadings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

And akin to the notion of the generality of deviancewhere those who engage in any given form of criminal behavior are also likely to engage in a wide array of other problematic behaviorswe examine whether failing at crime (getting arrested) is associated with other forms of life failure. Using data from multiple waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, our results reveal that, independent of one's level of self-reported criminal behavior and other key potential confounders (IQ and self-control), being arrested is a significant predictor of a host of life failures related to education, employment, relationships, and health. The key implication of our study is that it highlights the need to develop a theory of the generality of failure.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The purpose of this study was to examine the association between parental warmth and adolescent delinquency, the potential mediating roles of adolescent disclosure and parental knowledge, and gender differences in such association among Korean adolescents. We hypothesized that (1) parental warmth would be significantly and negatively associated with delinquency, (2) adolescent disclosure and parental knowledge would mediate the association between parental warmth and adolescent delinquency, and (3) the association between parental warmth and adolescent delinquency mediated through adolescent disclosure and parental knowledge would be stronger for adolescent girls than boys. Using a sample of 3125 Korean adolescents from nationally representative and longitudinal data (Korea Youth Panel Survey), results from path analyses demonstrated that findings were consistent with US samples, suggesting a negative association between parental warmth and adolescent delinquency. Further, when Korean adolescents perceived parents to be warmer, they were more likely to disclose personal information to their parents. In turn, higher levels of disclosure were associated with higher levels of parental knowledge about their adolescent children's activities. Finally, tests of gender differences suggested that parental warmth was more closely associated with adolescent disclosure among girls than boys. Results supported a process model through which parents may shape adolescent children's delinquency.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Silicon and oxygen are the two most abundant elements in most technological and geological glasses and glass forming liquids, and extensive studies of the structures of these materials have been made using Si-29 and O-17 high-resolution solid-state NMR. Double resonance NMR experiments hold great potential for revealing new details about the network structures of such important materials but have not yet been done for this particular pair of spins because of several technical challenges. Using a crystalline model compound, Ca3SiO5 (calcium trisilicate or the 'ante' phase of Portland cement), which contains oxide ion sites bonded either to one Si4+ or only to Ca2+, we demonstrate that the O-17 -> Si-29 Cross-Polarization Heteronuclear Correlation (CP-HETCOR) experiment can clearly distinguish between these two types of oxygen sites. The latter species, so-called 'free' oxide ions that are bonded to no network cations such as Si4+, play an important role in models of glass and melt structure but have been difficult to directly detect in many systems. In two-Ca/Mg silicate glasses near to the orthosilicate composition (O/Si >= 4), the HETCOR experiment clearly shows the presence of such 'free' oxide ions, whose 1D O-17 NMR signals are actually completely hidden under those for the predominant non-bridging oxygens. Their observed chemical shifts suggest coordination by predominantly Mg2+ cations, an ordering that may be expected from the smaller size and stronger bonding interactions of this cation relative to those of Ca2+. The estimated abundances of 'free' oxide ions in these glasses are consistent with previous, indirect estimates based on analyses of 1D Si-29 NMR spectra. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "There is compelling evidence that incidents of customer rage are on the rise and not just in Western, individualistic societies. Changing social and economic conditions in collectivist societies (e.g., emerging consumerism and rising wealth in China) have spawned the emergence of customer rage in Eastern countries. To this end, we examine how customer rage-associated emotions, expressions, and outcomes differ across Eastern and Western cultures. Results drawn from 982 frontline service customers from two Eastern (China and Thailand) and two Western (Australia and United States) countries show that although consumers from Western cultures are more likely to exhibit rage emotions, consumers from Eastern cultures are more likely to report a desire for revenge and express their emotions in both overt and more subtle ways. That is, customers from Eastern cultures, while slow to display anger, once initiated, their rage expressions toward frontline service workers tend to be physical and vengeful. This result contradicts generally held beliefs that Eastern consumers are reticent to express negative emotions. With these findings in mind, and to minimize damaging customer rage incidents, firms regularly engaged in cross-cultural service encounters need to provide intercultural awareness and communications training that equip frontline employees to understand customs, manners, etiquette, and expectations of Eastern and Western cultures in general and even specific cultural segments.",

Findings revealed gender differences in the predictive validity of the YLS/CMI in which girls scored significantly higher on the risk assessment, but recidivated at significantly lower rates than boys two years following the administration of the assessment. The predictive validity of the instrument was impacted by these gender differences in which the YLS/CMI total score was a better predictor of recidivism for boys (area under the curve (AUC) = .623) than girls (AUC = .565). The only subscales that significantly predicted recidivism for girls were the family (AUC = .607) and personality (AUC = .572) domains, whereas all of the subscales significantly predicted recidivism for boys. Directions for future research as well as gender-responsive assessment, programming, and policy implications are discussed.",

This study investigated common responses of police officers (n = 1108) to officer-perpetrated domestic violence case scenarios and the relationships between officer characteristics and such responses. Common responses included encouraging the victim to file a formal report, assisting in finding help for domestic abuse, and referring the offending officer to an employee assistance program (EAP) or counselor. Arrest was a likely response when officers were asked to imagine they witnessed a victim's injuries and heard statements about an assault in a case scenario. Supervisors had the most victim-supportive responses, suggesting they may be very good trainers of front-line officers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Anthropogenic controls on water and sediment may play important roles in river system transformations and morphological evolution, which could further affect coastal hydrodynamics and nutrient behavior. We used geochemical tracers to evaluate the influence of an intentional large release of water and sediment during the so-called \"Water Sediment Regulation Scheme\" (WSRS) on estuarine morphology, hydrodynamics and nutrients in the Yellow River estuary, China. We discovered that there was a newly formed small delta in the river mouth after the 2013 WSRS. This new morphologic feature altered terrestrial material distribution patterns from a single plume to a two-plume pattern within the estuary. Our results show that the WSRS significantly influenced the study area in the following ways: (1) Radium and nutrient concentrations were significantly elevated (two to four times), especially along the two river outlets. (2) Estuarine mixing was about two times stronger during WSRS than before. Average aerial mixing rates before and during WSRS were 50 +/- 26 km(2) d(-1) and 89 +/- 51 km(2) d(-1), respectively. (3) Our data is consistent with P limitation and suggest that stoichiometrically based P limitation was even more severe during WSRS. (4) All river-derived nutrients were thoroughly consumed within one to two weeks after entry to near-shore waters. (5) The extent of the area influenced by terrestrial nutrients was two to three times greater during WSRS. Human influence, such as triggered by WSRS regulations, should thus be considered when studying biogeochemical processes and nutrient budgets in situations like the Yellow River estuary.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents modular dynamics for dual-arms, expressed in terms of the kinematics and dynamics of each of the stand-alone manipulators. The two arms are controlled as a single manipulator in the task space that is relative to the two end-effectors of the dual-arm robot. A modular relative Jacobian, derived from a previous work, is used which is expressed in terms of the stand-alone manipulator Jacobians. The task space inertia is expressed in terms of the Jacobians and dynamics of each of the stand-alone manipulators. When manipulators are combined and controlled as a single manipulator, as in the case of dual-arms, our proposed approach will not require an entirely new dynamics model for the resulting combined manipulator. But one will use the existing Jacobians and dynamics model for each of the stand-alone manipulators to come up with the dynamics model of the combined manipulator. A dual-arm KUKA is used in the experimental implementation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Advanced ACTPol is a polarization-sensitive upgrade for the 6 m aperture Atacama Cosmology Telescope, adding new frequencies and increasing sensitivity over the previous ACTPol receiver. In 2016, Advanced ACTPol will begin to map approximately half the sky in five frequency bands (28-230 GHz). Its maps of primary and secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies-imaged in intensity and polarization at few arcminute-scale resolution-will enable precision cosmological constraints and also a wide array of cross-correlation science that probes the expansion history of the universe and the growth of structure via gravitational collapse. To accomplish these scientific goals, the Advanced ACTPol receiver will be a significant upgrade to the ACTPol receiver, including four new multichroic arrays of cryogenic, feedhorn-coupled AlMn transition edge sensor polarimeters (fabricated on 150 mm diameter wafers); a system of continuously rotating meta-material silicon half-wave plates; and a new multiplexing readout architecture which uses superconducting quantum interference devices and time division to achieve a 64-row multiplexing factor. Here we present the status and scientific goals of the Advanced ACTPol instrument, emphasizing the design and implementation of the Advanced ACTPol cryogenic detector arrays.",

The effect of fullerene incorporation on the structure and physical and chemical properties of PS membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, contact angle measurements, sorption experiments, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The transport properties of the mixed matrix membranes containing up to 0.5 wt% fullerene were studied for the pervaporation of ethyl acetate-water mixture. The new mixed-matrix membranes, developed in this study, were selective to water, whereas the PS-0.5 % C-60/MFFC composite membrane was found to have the best performance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A multiscale implementation of hybrid continuous/discontinuous finite element discretizations of nonlocal models for mechanics and diffusion in two dimensions is developed. The implementation features adaptive mesh refinement based on the detection of defects and results in an abrupt transition between refined elements that contain defects and unrefined elements free of defects. An additional difficulty overcome in the implementation is the design of accurate quadrature rules for stiffness matrix construction that are valid for any combination of the grid size and horizon parameter, the latter being the extent of nonlocal interactions. As a result, the methodology developed can attain optimal accuracy at very modest additional costs relative to situations for which the solution is smooth. Portions of the methodology can also be used for the optimal approximation, by piecewise linear polynomials, of given functions containing discontinuities. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the multiscale methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The objective of this paper is to evaluate the structural performance of a typical wind turbine tower subjected to strong ground motions. A detailed finite element model of an 80 m wind turbine tower was developed and subjected to strong ground motions. Two sets of input ground motions were used: one with pulse-type near-fault motions and the other one with far-fault motions. The structural performance of the wind turbine tower was investigated through seismic fragility analysis. The potential limit states were defined as global buckling of the tower, first occurrence of yielding, overturning of the foundation and permanent deformation of the tower. It was found that the wind turbine tower investigated in this study is most vulnerable to the overturning in the event of an earthquake. Yielding of the tower is the second most probable failure mechanism, which is followed by development of permanent deformation and global buckling of the tower. Similar trends in the failure mechanism were observed for both near-fault and far-fault ground motions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Given the high rates of suicide among military personnel and the need to characterize suicide risk factors associated with mental health service use, this study aimed to identify suicide-relevant factors that predict: (1) treatment engagement and treatment adherence, and (2) suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and major depressive episodes in a military sample. Army recruiters (N = 2596) completed a battery of self-report measures upon study enrollment. Eighteen months later, information regarding suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, major depressive episodes, and mental health visits were obtained from participants' military medical records. Suicide attempts and suicidal ideation were very rare in this sample; negative binomial regression analyses with robust estimation were used to assess correlates and predictors of mental health treatment visits and major depressive episodes. More severe insomnia and agitation were significantly associated with mental health visits at baseline and over the 18-month study period. In contrast, suicide-specific hopelessness was significantly associated with fewer mental health visits. Insomnia severity was the only significant predictor of major depressive episodes. Findings suggest that assessment of sleep problems might be useful in identifying at-risk military service members who may engage in mental health treatment. Additional research is warranted to examine the predictive validity of these suicide-related symptom measures in a more representative, higher suicide risk military sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have defined the phenomenon by exploring 'what happens when/if questions and analyzing these in the context of the specified phenomenon occurrence. While ITS often focus on student decisions regarding when and how to use the system's resources, we suggest further analysis and monitoring are needed to get the best results from these systems. In this study, we argue that boys interact differently with ITS than girls. This finding is evident in results from both the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Learning Curve Analysis models.

      "Abstract Note" : "Current conceptualizations of marketing decision-making center on behavioral and cultural aspects of information flow and inter-functional coordination but neglect the cognitive, sense-making aspects of team decision-making. To fill this gap in existing business market literature, this study provides a cognitive based model of team market awareness. Drawing on theory related to entrepreneurial alertness, the paper develops constructs of management team awareness and symmetry of awareness distribution that are tested empirically. Results reveal that the management team's ability to perceive, comprehend and predict market elements (team market awareness) leads to higher firm performance. Further, the effect of team market awareness on team performance is strengthened when the team has asymmetric distribution of awareness, whereby a team's members have an accurate awareness of different market elements. Finally, team market awareness also has a stronger impact on team performance when the team has a high level of agreement on cross-functional tactics. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Previous literature has suggested that examining Twitter messages can be productive for studying how the public shares and spreads health information on social media. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising approach to HIV prevention, yet there are many issues that may influence its effective implementation. This study examined social representations of PrEP on Twitter. One thousand four hundred and thirty-five Tweets were collected and 774 English Tweets were content-analyzed to explore propagation of various issues around daily oral PrEP, as well as characteristics of the sources of those Tweets. We also examined how Twitter message content influenced information propagation. Our findings revealed that PrEP-related information on Twitter covered a wide range of issues, and individual users constituted the majority of the Tweet creators among all the sources, including news media, nonprofit and academic groups, and commercial entities. Using Poisson regression, we also found that a Tweet's affective tone was a significant predictor of message propagation frequency. Implications for health practitioners are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Drawing from the inequality and crime, racial invariance, and Latino paradox literatures, the effects of inequality on youth reoffending are examined. Specifically, hierarchical logistic regression models are estimated to determine: (1) whether racial and ethnic inequality have similar contextual effects on the continued delinquent behavior of at-risk youth and (2) whether these effects are specific to black or Latino/a youth residing in Maricopa County, Arizona (N=13,138). Findings suggest that racial inequality increases reoffending while ethnic inequality decreases reoffending. Additionally, Latino/a youth are less likely to reoffend in areas characterized by high income and racial inequality. Structural theories of crime should continue to account for the importance of culture and the resilient responses employed by Latinos/as living in criminogenic environments.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Surrogate modeling is a popular and practical method to meet the needs of a large number of queries of computationally demanding models in the analysis of uncertainty, sensitivity and system reliability. We explore various methods that can improve the accuracy of a particular class of surrogate models, the high dimensional model representation (HDMR), and their performances in uncertainty quantification and variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Rigorous analysis is provided to show the equivalence of the two common types of HDMRs Cut-HDMR and random sampling-HDMR (RS-HDMR), when they are the same order of truncation. We propose using the nodes of Gauss and Clenshaw-Curtis quadratures as the interpolation points for the construction of Cut-HDMR to achieve high (spectral) accuracy for both the surrogate model and global sensitivity indices. As for RS-HDMR, randomized quasi-Monte Carlo sampling with variance reduction techniques, coupled with a procedure to select the optimal polynomial orders and prune potential noise terms, is shown to be capable of effectively enhancing the model accuracy. The efficiency of our proposed methods is demonstrated by a few analytical examples that are commonly studied for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis algorithms. Finally, we apply HDMR surrogate modeling techniques for an operational wildland fire model that is widely employed in fire prevention and safety control, and a chemical kinetics H-2/air combustion model predicting the ignition delay time, which plays an important role in studying fuel and combustion system reliability and safety.

      "Abstract Note" : "Computational modeling is essential for structural characterization of biomolecular mechanisms across the broad spectrum of scales. Adequate understanding of biomolecular mechanisms inherently involves our ability to model them. Structural modeling of individual biomolecules and their interactions has been rapidly progressing. However, in terms of the broader picture, the focus is shifting toward larger systems, up to the level of a cell. Such modeling involves a more dynamic and realistic representation of the interactomes in vivo, in a crowded cellular environment, as well as membranes and membrane proteins, and other cellular components. Structural modeling of a cell complements computational approaches to cellular mechanisms based on differential equations, graph models, and other techniques to model biological networks, imaging data, etc. Structural modeling along with other computational and experimental approaches will provide a fundamental understanding of life at the molecular level and lead to important applications to biology and medicine. A cross section of diverse approaches presented in this review illustrates the developing shift from the structural modeling of individual molecules to that of cell biology. Studies in several related areas are covered: biological networks; automated construction of three-dimensional cell models using experimental data; modeling of protein complexes; prediction of non-specific and transient protein interactions; thermodynamic and kinetic effects of crowding; cellular membrane modeling; and modeling of chromosomes. The review presents an expert opinion on the current state-of-the-art in these various aspects of structural modeling in cellular biology, and the prospects of future developments in this emerging field.

The short-range structure of molybdenum tellurite glasses consists of TeO4, TeO3 and MoO6 structural units. Increase in MoO3 concentration from 20 to 50 mol% decreases the Te-O coordination from 3.48 to 326 and lowers the glass transition temperature (T-g) due to increase in the concentration of weaker Mo-O bonds at the expense of stronger Te-O bonds. Refractive index of molybdenum tellurite glasses increases while the dielectric constant decreases with increase in MoO3 concentration. The addition of B2O3 in the tellurite network enhances Tg and suppresses the tendency towards crystallization. The effects of 8203 are similar to that of MoO3 and it produces structural transformations: TeO4 -> TeO3 and BO4 -> BO3. The addition of B2O3 does not significantly modify the optical properties but the dielectric constant decreases by a small amount. Glass sample of 20MoO(3)-80TeO(2) was annealed at 280 degrees C for similar to 500 h and changes in its density and thermal properties were studied; it was found that the annealing increases the glass density slightly, but it causes a drastic enhancement of Tg by 10 degrees C, due to the structural rearrangements in the intermediate range order without effecting Te-O and Mo-O speciation.

      "Abstract Note" : "The role of a mafic component in the petrogenesis of Oceanic Island Basalts (OIBs) is highly debated. As the best studied OIB, Hawaiian lavas provide critical insights into OIB genesis. At a given MgO content, the CaO content in the melt has been used to distinguish between partial melts of peridotite and garnet pyroxenite/eclogite. However, calculations using the BATCH program show that CaO contents in volatile-free melts saturated with all four phases, garnet, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and olivine, are controlled by both degrees of partial melting and source compositions, and low melt CaO content is not diagnostic of partial melts from garnet pyroxenite/eclogite. This is an important consideration in understanding the origin of high-CaO lavas recovered from the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP). Detailed geochemical and isotopic studies have been focused on the HSDP high- and low-SiO2 group lavas, and high-CaO lavas were not well studied because they were not included in the original reference suite samples. Here, we report trace element abundances obtained on a suite of high-CaO glasses and compared the trace element abundances of high-CaO lavas to those in high- and low-SiO2 lavas. When normalized to the average composition of low-SiO2 lavas, high-CaO lavas form a U-shaped trace element pattern, enriched in both the most incompatible (Nb, Th) and the least incompatible (Sc, V) elements. This compositional distinction is best explained if high-CaO parental magma represents a mixture of a low degree partial melt of the low-SiO2 mantle source with a high degree (>80%) partial melt derived from a mafic cumulate component. This mafic cumulate must be clinopyroxenerich, and it could be delaminated mafic cumulate formed under arcs during continent formation, lower continental crust, recycled lower oceanic crust, or high pressure cumulates from a magma chamber.

      "Abstract Note" : "Approximately coeval, relatively primitive (similar to 5-10% MgO with exception of a trachyandesite) alkaline mafic dikes and sills at or near Spanish Peaks, CO are divided into relatively sodic and potassic varieties on the basis of K2O/Na2O. Many of these dikes are true lamprophyres. In spite of variable alkali element ratios, the alkaline rocks share a number of geochemical similarities: high LIL element contents, high Ba and similar Sr, Nd and Hf isotope ratios near that of Bulk Earth. One important difference is that the potassic rocks are characterized by lower Al2O3 contents, typically less than 12 wt.%, than the sodic dikes/sills which typically have more than 13 wt.% Al2O3, and this difference is independent of MgO content. We attribute the distinct Al2O3 contents to varying pressure during melting: a mica-bearing, Al-poor vein assemblage for the potassic magmas melted at higher pressure than an aluminous amphibole-bearing vein assemblage for the sodic magmas. Remarkable isotopic and trace element similarities with approximately contemporaneous, nearby Rio Grande rift-related basalts in the San Luis Valley, indicate that the magmatism at Spanish Peaks was rift-related, and that lithosphere sources were shared between some rift magmas and those at Spanish Peaks. High Zn/Fe ratios in the Spanish Peaks mafic rocks point to a clinopyroxene and garnet-rich source such as lithosphere veined by pyroxenite or eclogite. Lithospheric melting was possibly triggered by foundering of cool, dense lithosphere beneath the Rio Grande rift during the initiation of rifting with the potassic parent magmas generated by higher pressure melting of the foundered lithosphere than the sodic parent magmas. This process, caused by gravitational instability of the lithosphere (Elkins-Tanton, 2007) may be common beneath active continental rifts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A pioneer delta C-13(org) study through the upper Sandbian and Katian (Upper Ordovician) succession in the Rostanga 1 drill core in the classical geological outcrop area at Rostanga in southernmost Sweden produced a wealth of new carbon isotope data which are useful for local and regional correlations. Among the Upper Ordovician positive delta C-13 excursions, the Guttenberg (GICE), Waynesville (Saunja), Whitewater (Moe), Paroveja, and Hirnantian (HICE) isotopic carbon excursions are recognized but the Kope (Rakvere) delta C-13 excursion is missing, suggesting a stratigraphic gap. All these isotopic excursions are tied closely to biostratigraphy, especially graptolite biostratigraphy, and in the case of the Waynesville (Saunja) and Whitewater (Moe) excursions, for the first time anywhere in the world. The Rostanga GICE delta C-13(org) curve from the upper Sularp Shale shows a striking similarity to that of the Katian GSSP in Oklahoma, suggesting the potential of trans-Atlantic correlation. Based on a projection from the Katian GSSP, the previously poorly constrained position of the base of the Katian in southern Sweden appears to be in the uppermost Sularp Shale in strata of the upper Diplograptus foliaceus Zone. Previous interpretations of the relations between K-bentonite successions in southern Scandinavia are somewhat revised and the Kinnekulle K-bentonite is recognized for the first time in Scania. Based on new radiometric dates, this very prominent and widespread ash bed appears to be slightly older than the Deicke and Millbrig K-bentonites in eastern North America. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "To better understand the effects of deafness on the brain, these experiments examine how disrupted balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission following the loss of excitatory input from the auditory nerve alters the central auditory system. In the avian cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM), deprivation of excitatory input induced by deafness triggers neuronal death. While this neuronal death was previously accredited to the loss of excitatory drive, the present experiments examine an alternative hypothesis: that inhibitory input to NM, which may also be affected by deafness, contributes to neuronal death in NM. Using an in vitro slice preparation in which excitatory input from the auditory nerve is absent, we pharmacologically altered GABA receptor activation in NM, and assayed an early marker of neuronal health, antigenicity for the ribosomal antibody Y10B (Y10B-ir). We found that GABA decreases Y10B-ir, and that GABA(A) activation is necessary for the GABA-induced effect. We further found that endogenous GABA(A) activation similarly decreases Y10B-ir and this decrease requires extracellular Ca2+. Our results suggest that, in the absence of excitatory input, endogenous activation of ionotropic GABA(A) receptors is detrimental to NM neurons. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "For decades, it has been known that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is a nonadequate operationalization of psychopathy (Crego & Widiger, 2015). The DSM-5 alternative model of personality disorders provides an opportunity to rectify some of these long held concerns. The current study compared the Section III alternative model's trait-based conception of ASPD with the categorical model from the main diagnostic codes section of DSM-5 in terms of associations with differing models of psychopathy. We also evaluated the validity of the trait-based conception more broadly in relation to measures of antisocial tendencies as well as psychopathy. Participants were 200 male inmates who were administered a battery of self-report and interview-based researcher rating measures of relevant constructs. Analyses showed that Section III ASPD outperformed Section II ASPD in predicting scores on Hare's (2003) Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; r = .88 vs. .59). Additionally, aggregate scores for Section III ASPD performed well in capturing variance in differing ASPD and psychopathy measures. Finally, we found that the Section III ASPD impairment criteria added incrementally to the Section III ASPD traits in predicting PCL-R psychopathy and SCID-II ASPD.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent research has sought to understand how individuals high in psychopathic traits perceive pain in others (Decety, Skelly, & Kiehl, 2013; Marsh et al., 2013). Perception of pain in others is presumed to act as a prosocial signal, and underreactivity to others' pain may contribute to engagement in exploitative-aggressive behaviors among individuals high in psychopathic traits (Jackson, Meltzoff, & Decety, 2005). The current study tested for associations between facets of psychopathy as defined by the triarchic model (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009) and decreased sensitivity to pain in 105 undergraduates tested in a laboratory pain assessment. A pressure algometer was used to index pain tolerance, and participants also rated their perceptions of and reactivity to the algometer-induced pain during the assessment and again 3 days later. A unique positive relationship was found between pain tolerance and the meanness facet of psychopathy, which also predicted reduced fear of painful algometer stimulation. Other psychopathy facets (boldness, disinhibition) showed negative relations with fear of pain stimulation during testing and at follow-up. Findings from this study extend the nomological network surrounding callousness (meanness) and suggest that increased pain tolerance may be a mechanism contributing to insensitivity to expressions of discomfort in others.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Pangasius fish, primarily Pangasius hypophthalmus (tra/swai) and Pangasius bocourti (basa) belonging to the Pangasiidae family of catfish, are an imported farm-raised freshwater fish. The labels \"tra/swai\" and \"basa\" seldom appear on restaurant menus, so it is unclear how and to what extent pangasius is used in restaurants. In this study, we investigated 47 different fish products served at 37 restaurants in a city in the southeastern United States. A commercial rapid lateral flow (LF) assay (EZ Pangasius (TM) kit) was used to identify pangasius fish and the results were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a pangasius-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) T7E10. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was then employed to examine the protein patterns in the ready-to-eat fish samples. The results showed that 26.7% of the domestic catfish (Ictaluridae family) and 22.2% of the grouper dishes served were actually pangasius. A high percentage (66.7%) of dishes displayed under the general name of \"fish\" on the menu were also identified as pangasius, revealing the widespread but economically favorable and/or fraudulent use of this fish in the restaurant industry. The IEF results revealed that the pangasius positive samples were exclusively tra/swai. There was no significant difference in the prices charged to restaurant customers between pangasius negative and positive samples, indicating that price is not a good indicator of fish authenticity. These findings highlight the need for stringent enforcement of the existing regulations to discourage the fraudulent use of pangasius fish, either tra/swai or basa. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper, we study the problem of detection of underwater minefields amidst dense clutter as that of statistical inference under a spatial point-process model. Specifically, we model the locations ( mine and clutter) as samples of a Thomas point process with parent locations representing mines and children representing clutter. Accordingly, the parents are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson process and, given the parent locations, the children are distributed as independent Poisson processes with intensity functions that are Gaussian densities centered at the parents. This provides a likelihood function for parent locations given the observed clutter ( children). Under this model, we develop a framework for penalized maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of model parameters and parent locations. The optimization is performed using a combination of analytical and Monte Carlo methods; the Monte Carlo part relies on a birth-death-move procedure for adding/removing points in the parent set. This framework is illustrated using both simulated and real data sets, the latter obtained courtesy of Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD), Panama City, FL, USA. The results, evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, underscore success in estimating parent locations and other parameters, at a reasonable computation cost.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Emerging evidence suggests that children's sensitivity to suprasegmental phonology such as stress and timing (i.e., prosodic sensitivity) contributes to reading. The primary goal of this study was to investigate pathways of the relation of prosodic sensitivity to reading (word reading and reading comprehension) using data from 370 first-grade children. Specifically, we examined (a) the nature of the relations of prosodic sensitivity to word reading by systematically testing five alternative models (i.e., direct relations and indirect relations via phonological awareness or morphological awareness) after accounting for letter naming fluency and rapid automatized naming and (b) the relation of prosodic sensitivity to reading comprehension (a direct relation over and above word reading and listening comprehension, or an indirect relation via word reading and listening comprehension). A prosodic sensitivity task tapping into stress and timing (i.e., word stress task) was used. Structural equation model results showed that prosodic sensitivity was not directly related to word reading. Instead, its relation was completely mediated by phonological awareness and morphological awareness. Furthermore, once word reading, listening comprehension, and working memory were accounted for, prosodic sensitivity was not related to reading comprehension. Therefore, it appears that prosodic sensitivity makes a contribution to word reading primarily via phonological awareness and morphological awareness, and its influence on reading comprehension is via word reading and listening comprehension. These results suggest that explicit attention to prosodic sensitivity might be beneficial for developing phonological awareness and morphological awareness, which, in turn, improve reading skills.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The effect of electromagnetic stirring (EMS) on microstructure and performance of Ag-8 mass%Ni composite was investigated under both solidified and deformed conditions. Without EMS, the Ag matrix formed short, thick dendrites in the ingot; whereas with EMS, dendrites were long and slim. Ni phase mainly formed particles or ribbons, distributed along boundaries between dendrite arms. Cold drawing of the solidified Ag-Ni ingots, both with and without EMS, produced high strength in-situ metal-matrix composite (MMC) consisting of Ag matrix reinforced by Ni ribbons. EMS improved the ductility of the composite, consequently enhancing its drawability and strength. EMS also increased the electrical conductivity in both solidified ingots and deformed in-situ composite wires. In both cases, hardness and tensile strength remained high. A model based on a combination of the modified linear rule of mixtures and the Hall-Petch relationship was used to rationalize the tensile strength and hardness with respect to its fabrication parameters and the microstructure of Ag-Ni in-situ composite.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Resistance training (RT) is a core component of cardiac rehabilitation. We investigated the effects of RT on exercise capacity, muscle strength, and mobility in middle-aged and elderly patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials of RT versus usual care, or combined RT and aerobic training (AT) versus AT alone, and identified 440 trials in total from inception to January 2014. Participants who had myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina pectoris or CAD were included in the analysis. Those who had heart failure, heart transplants with either cardiac resynchronization therapy or implantable defibrillators were excluded. Results: Twenty-two trials totaling 1095 participants were analyzed. We performed random-effects meta-analysis. In middle-aged participants, RT increased lower extremity muscle strength [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35 to 0.95], upper extremity muscle strength (SMD: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.48 to 0.99) and peak oxygen consumption (VO2) [weight mean difference (WMD): 0.92 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.72], but did not improve mobility compared with the control. In elderly participants, RT increased lower extremity muscle strength (SMD: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.05 to 1.21), upper extremity muscle strength (SMD: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.80), and peak V02 (WMD: 0.70 mL/kg/min, 95% CI: 0.03 to 1.37), and improved mobility (SMD: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.21 to 1.01) compared with the control. Conclusions: Resistance training could increase exercise capacity and muscle strength in middle-aged and elderly patients, and mobility in elderly patients, with CAD.

      "Abstract Note" : "Rationale: For patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the use of inhaled antibiotics has become standard of care to suppress chronic Pseudomonas airways infection. There are limited antibiotic options formulated and approved for inhaled use and antibiotic efficacies attenuate over time, making additional inhaled antibiotic classes desirable. APT-1026 (levofloxacin inhalation solution, LIS) is a fluoroquinolone in development for management of chronic P. aeruginosa airways infection in patients with CF. Objectives: To compare the safety and efficacy of a 28-day course of treatment with LIS 240 mg or placebo BID in persons >= 12 years old with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Methods: A multinational, randomized.(2:1), double-blinded study of LIS and placebo over 28 days in CF patients >= 12 years with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Time to exacerbation was the primary endpoint. FEV1 (% predicted) and patient-reported quality of life were among secondary endpoints. Main results: Baseline demographics for 330 subjects (LIS = 220) were similar although significantly more patients randomized to LIS had experienced multiple exacerbations in the year prior to study entry. There was no statistically significant difference in protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations between treatment arms. Relative change in FEV1% predicted from baseline was significantly greater for patients randomized to LIS compared to those randomized to placebo (mean difference 1.31%, p = 0.01 [95% CI 0.27, 2.34%]). LIS was well-tolerated, with dysguesia the most frequent adverse event. Conclusions: LIS did not demonstrate a difference in time to next exacerbation when compared to placebo. Reasons for this result are discussed but may be due to an imbalance in the frequency of prior pulmonary exacerbations between the two groups. An improvement in FEV1 (% predicted) at 28 days was observed and LIS was well tolerated. LIS is safe and has a potential role in the management of CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa.

      "Abstract Note" : "Three studies examined school burnout and self-control. Study 1 investigated their association in two independent undergraduate samples (N = 243, N = 126) and documented a consistent, negative relationship between dispositional self-control and school burnout when controlling for affective symptomology. Study 2 (N = 428) examined whether dispositional self-control moderated the relationship between school burnout and important academic outcomes (grade point average, absenteeism). A school burnout by dispositional self-control interaction emerged such that poorer academic outcomes occurred at higher levels of school burnout when levels of self-control were lower. Using an experimental design, Study 3 (N = 477) evaluated the casual relationship between school burnout and state self-control. Individuals induced to experience low rather than high state self-control demonstrated a stronger association between school burnout and arithmetic performance. These findings highlight the critical role of dispositional and state self-control in moderating school burnout. Directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "This study aims to investigate academic librarians' organizational socialization. Successful socialization can increase librarians' commitments to and retention in the libraries, which may enhance the quality of information services to library patrons. In addition to collecting demographic information, we measured the organizational socialization of 314 academic librarians using Chao, O'Leary-Kelly, Wolf, Klein, and Gardner's (1994) content framework. Study participants possessed high levels of socialization in their libraries overall. They were well socialized in Politics, followed by Performance Proficiency (task/skills), and Language; however, their socialization in Organizational goals/values, History, and People were relatively low, suggesting that there is room for improvement. Other key findings are: (1) male participants had lower levels of socialization in the People dimension than did females; (2) participants who were tenured had higher levels of socialization than did those who had not yet achieved tenure; (3) participants who had informal mentoring experiences had higher levels of socialization overall compared to those who had not received any mentoring; and (4) participants' socialization was associated negatively with the number of employees in their libraries and with the highest degree offered by their institutions. The study findings can be used to understand the learning and adjustment process of academic librarians in the United States, predict their retention and job satisfaction, and develop and improve library training or orientation programs.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Although studies suggest that employment promotes mental health, it is unclear whether this pattern extends to low-income urban women with children who are disproportionately employed in unstable jobs and often unable to obtain child care. In this paper, we consider whether becoming employed reduces symptoms of psychological distress among low-income women with children. We also assess whether having trouble securing adequate child care offsets these benefits. Study Design: We use longitudinal data from the Welfare, Children, and Families project, a probability sample of low-income women with children living in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, to test whether becoming employed reduces symptoms of psychological distress over time and whether having trouble securing child care moderates this association. Results: We find that employment is associated with lower levels of distress among women who have no trouble with child care and higher levels of distress among women who struggle with child care. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that valuing the benefits of paid work over unpaid work is an oversimplification and that the emphasis on placing poor women with children into paid work could be misguided. Policies that focus on moving low-income women off of government assistance and into paid work could be more effective if greater resources were devoted to increasing access to quality child care.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper introduces a novel topology for generating a spatial third-harmonic current component to excite the rotor field winding of a wound rotor synchronous machine to achieve brushless operation. In this topology, each of the three-phase windings on the stator is connected with a switch in parallel. In particular, two antiparallel thyristors are used to switch during positive and negative half cycles. Two windings are mounted on the rotor of the machine: 1) the harmonic winding and 2) the field winding. Zero-sequence currents are generated, when the switches are closed near zero crossing for a short time interval. Consecutive operation of the switches creates an additional spatial third-harmonic current pulsating in the stator winding. The number of poles of the stator winding and the field winding is the same (four-poles in this case) to intercept the torque generation component of the air-gap flux, whereas, the number of poles of the harmonic windings is adjusted (12-poles in this case) to intercept the harmonic component of the air-gap flux and develop voltage across the harmonic windings. Harmonic voltage is rectified through a rotating rectifier to feed dc current to the field windings. Results verify the proposed topology simulated by a 2-D finite-element method.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents an optimal design of the rotor pole in a novel axial-flux brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (AF-BDFRM), which features higher torque and power density than its counterpart radial-flux BDFRM. The rotor span and rotor overhang lengths were the optimized parameters, with the goals of improving torque density and improving the quality of the output power, i.e., reducing the torque ripple. The optimal design process was applied to obtain the optimized shape for maximizing torque density while minimizing torque ripple in a 16 kW machine. Then, the optimal design results were verified by means of the transient 3-D finite-element analysis. Furthermore, the results of the optimally designed rotor pole were compared with those of a previously developed diamond shape. Finally, a sample prototype of one HP was selected for testing, considering the manufacturing cost and available testing facilities to verify the proper working of the novel AF-BDFRM.",

The design target is to experimentally verify the sinusoidal back electromotive force (EMF) considering the mechanical stress limitation of the machine at a speed of 32 000 r/min. Two machine models based on ferrite and SmCo PMs have been proposed. First, the back EMF analysis using a 3-D finite-element method is performed to determine the performance of the two models. Second, the mechanical stress analysis is performed to check the durability of the rotor strength. Finally, the selected model utilizing the ferrite PMs has been manufactured and tested at 32 000 r/min to validate its effectiveness at high-speed operation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Conventional permanent magnet (PM) motors operate in both magnetizing (pull) process and reversible demagnetizing (push) process on the recoil line of magnets. Therefore, thin-surface PMs may easily undergo a risk of demagnetization at the push process under certain fault conditions, which lead to deterioration of motor performance. Thus, thick magnets, whereas contributing the significantly high cost, are usually used to minimize this risk in the PM motors. In this paper, a novel operation technique, that involves only the pull process, has been proposed for a unique design of two-phase brushless DC motor to avoid the irreversible demagnetization of the magnets. The motor, operated only in the pull process, is kept away from the push process of the operation. Therefore, the motor sustains its initial magnetic operating point above the knee point during the normal operation as well as under the short circuit fault conditions. Finite-element analysis is performed to validate the concept of the proposed technique.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The interactions between low-Reynolds-number fluid flow and an electroactive membrane wing is characterized to illustrate changes in harmonic and transient behavior from electric field excitation of the membrane wing. The wing is constructed of a dielectric elastomer material that changes its tension as a function of the applied field. The field excitation leads to changes in the shape of the wing under aerodynamic loads and subsequently, increased lift and delay of stall. Prior work in time-averaged lift and drag characterization is extended to better understand dynamic characteristics. Benchtop membrane structural dynamics are compared with visual image correlation, hotwire measurements, and particle image velocimetry within a low-Reynolds-number wind tunnel. An applied electric field leads to a 13.7% reduction in structural resonance of the membrane under ambient conditions while wind tunnel measurements illustrate a 5.1% reduction in resonance under the same applied field. Despite these differences, the structural and fluid dynamic harmonics are closely correlated for low-Reynolds-number flow at 10m/s.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The timing of morning endurance competition may limit proper pre-race fueling and resulting performance. A nighttime, pre-sleep nutritional strategy could be an alternative method to target the metabolic and hydrating needs of the early morning athlete without compromising sleep or gastrointestinal comfort during exercise. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the acute effects of pre-sleep chocolate milk (CM) ingestion on next-morning running performance, metabolism, and hydration status. Twelve competitive female runners and triathletes (age, 30 +/- 7 years; peak oxygen consumption, 53 +/- 4 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) randomly ingested either pre-sleep CM or non-nutritive placebo (PL) similar to 30 min before sleep and 7-9 h before a morning exercise trial. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was assessed prior to exercise. The exercise trial included a warm-up, three 5-min incremental workloads at 55%, 65%, and 75% peak oxygen consumption, and a 10-km treadmill time trial (TT). Physiological responses were assessed prior, during (incremental and TT), and postexercise. Paired t tests and magnitude-based inferences were used to determine treatment differences. TT performances were not different (\"most likely trivial\" improvement with CM) between conditions (PL: 52.8 +/- 8.4 min vs CM: 52.8 +/- 8.0 min). RMR was \"likely\" increased (4.8%) and total carbohydrate oxidation (g.min(-1)) during exercise was \"possibly\" or likely increased (18.8%, 10.1%, 9.1% for stage 1-3, respectively) with CM versus PL. There were no consistent changes to hydration indices. In conclusion, pre-sleep CM may alter next-morning resting and exercise metabolism to favor carbohydrate oxidation, but effects did not translate to 10-km running performance improvements.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Ongoing exposure to social stressors is widely believed to undermine the health of Hispanic immigrant families. The current work aims to explore and interpret expressions of familismo as a framework through which postimmigration experiences are interpreted and potentially given meaning. Method: Qualitative data were obtained from 16 focus groups in California and Massachusetts (N = 93). Fifty-two percent of the participants identified as male and 59% primarily spoke Spanish. Results: Analyses revealed 3 distinct forms of ambivalence specific to familismo among Hispanic adults from immigrant families. Give and take described experiences wherein immigrants turn their backs on family in the short term to realize a better long-term future for the family. Negative change explained family misfortunes that arise in the pursuit of a better future for the family and creates doubts about the vision that motivated migration. Forced shifts suggests the navigation of daily life necessitates the inversion or abandonment of culturally idealized family roles and responsibilities. Conclusion: Hispanic adults from immigrant families described several situations in which competing views of familismo likely influenced the interpretation of unanticipated stressors.",

The Kenya Primary Math and Reading (PRIMR) study implemented a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects and cost of three interventions - e-readers for students, tablets for teachers, and the base PRIMR program with tablets for instructional supervisors. The results show that the ICT investments do not improve literacy outcomes significantly more than the base non-ICT instructional program.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: To better understand the effects of taste cues on delaying the attention shift from an external focus (dissociative) towards an internal focus (associative) as exercise intensity increases. Design: A between subjects' experimental design with random assignment to three groups: taste (lemon-flavored mouth guards), placebo (unflavored mouth guards), or control group (no mouth guards) was used. Participants reported perceived exertion, affect (i.e., pleasantness and arousal), and attention allocation before, during, and after performing a weighted stepping task. Results: Performing the task resulted in a gradual increase of perceived exertion, F (1.87, 74.89) = 63.05, p < .05, eta(2)(p) = .61, along with a shift from dissociative to associative attention, F (2.17, 86.68) = 35.57, p < .05, eta(2)(p) = .47 across all conditions. Additionally, participants reported feeling less pleasant and more aroused after task completion in all conditions. The lemon-flavored mouth guard failed to affect attention, F (4.33, 86.68) = 1.41, p = .23, eta(2)(p) = .07, perceived exertion, F (3.74, 74.86) = .38, p = .81, eta(2)(p) = .02, pleasantness, F (2, 40) = .126, p = .88, eta(2)(p) = .01, and arousal, F (2, 40) = 2.40, p = .10, eta(2)(p) = .10, differently than the other two conditions. Conclusions: The study was one of the first to examine the effects of taste during an exertive task. Despite the non-significant effects of using a lemon-taste mouth guard on various cognitive variables (perception of exertion, attention allocation, pleasantness, and arousal), more scientific effort is needed to explore the effects of other tastes (e.g., sweet, bitter) and delivery methods (e.g., sprays, drops).

      "Abstract Note" : "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is an indispensable tool in breast imaging for many indications. Several functional parameters with MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) have been assessed for imaging of breast tumors and their combined application is defined as multiparametric imaging. Available data suggest that multiparametric imaging using different functional MRI and PET parameters can provide detailed information about the hallmarks of cancer and may provide additional specificity. Multiparametric and molecular imaging of the breast comprises established MRI parameters, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), MR proton spectroscopy (H-1-MRSI) as well as combinations of radiological and MRI techniques (e. g. PET/CT and PET/MRI) using radiotracers, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Multiparametric and molecular imaging of the breast can be performed at different field-strengths (range 1.5-7 T). Emerging parameters comprise novel promising techniques, such as sodium imaging (Na-23 MRI), phosphorus spectroscopy (P-31-MRSI), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) and hyperpolarized MRI as well as various specific radiotracers. Multiparametric and molecular imaging has multiple applications in breast imaging. Multiparametric and molecular imaging of the breast is an evolving field that will enable improved detection, characterization, staging and monitoring for personalized medicine in breast cancer.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Convective plumes emanating from fixed buoyant sources such as volcanoes, hot springs and oil spills are common in the atmosphere and the ocean. Most of what we know about their dynamics comes from scaling laws, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. A plume grows laterally during its ascent mainly due to the process of turbulent entrainment of fluid from the environment into the plume. In an unstratified system, nothing hampers the vertical motion of the plume. By contrast, in a stratified system, as the plume rises, it reaches and overshoots the neutral buoyancy height - due to the non-zero momentum at that height. This rising fluid is then dense relative to the environment and slows down, ceases to rise and falls back to the height of the intrusion. For buoyant plumes occurring in the ocean or atmosphere, the rotation of the Earth adds an additional constraint via the conservation of angular momentum. In fact, the effect of rotation is still not well understood, and we addressed this issue in the study reported here. We looked for the steady states of an axisymmetric model in both the rotating and non-rotating cases. At the non-rotating limit, we isolated two regimes of convection depending on the buoyancy flux/momentum flux ratio at the base of the plume, in agreement with scaling laws. However, the inclusion of rotation in the model strongly affects these classical convection patterns: the lateral extension of the plume is confined at the intrusion level by the establishment of a geostrophic balance, and non-trivial swirl speed develops in and around the plume.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Trip chaining represents a way to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) that does not require people to shift away from driving private automobiles. While the existing literature on trip chaining acknowledges this potential, little has been done by way of quantifying this. This research seeks to fill this gap by using a large travel survey from the San Francisco Bay area to model the VMT generated by automobile tours as a function of tour composition (i.e., the number and type of destinations on that tour). The model results indicate that many tours involving trips chains (i.e., those tours with more than one destination) generate significantly less VMT than would occur if the destinations in these tours were split into multiple tours with single destinations. Tours that combine a work and non-work destination (which are the most common types of trip chains) particularly demonstrate potential for VMT reduction. Adding a non-work destination to a work tour is usually (depending on the specific type of destination) predicted to result in a reduction of 6-11 VMT, or about 20-30 %. Adding two non-work destinations to a work tour is usually predicted to result in a reduction of 10-22 VMT, or about 25-50 %.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity. Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly. Residual lifespan increased by 57 % when colonies were penned for 20 days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory. Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population size declined when mortality exceeded 4 % per day. Experimental increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks, opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger workers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Gulf of Mexico ecosystem is a hotspot for biological diversity and supports a number of industries, from tourism to fishery production to oil and gas exploration, that serve as the economic backbone of Gulf coast states. The Gulf is a natural hydrocarbon basin, rich with stores of oil and gas that lie in reservoirs deep beneath the seafloor. The natural seepage of hydrocarbons across the Gulf system is extensive and, thus, the system's biological components experience ephemeral, if not, frequent, hydrocarbon exposure. In contrast to natural seepage, which is diffuse and variable over space and time, the 2010 Macondo oil well blowout, represented an intense, focused hydrocarbon infusion to the Gulf's deepwaters. The Macondo blowout drove rapid shifts in microbial populations and activity, revealed unexpected phenomena, such as deepwater hydrocarbon plumes and marine \"oil snow\" sedimentation, and impacted the Gulf's pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Understanding the distribution and fate of Macondo oil was limited to some degree by an insufficient ability to predict the physical movement of water in the Gulf. In other words, the available physical oceanographic models lacked critical components. In the past six years, much has been learned about the physical oceanography of the Gulf, providing transformative knowledge that will improve the ability to predict the movement of water and the hydrocarbons they carry in future blowout scenarios. Similarly, much has been learned about the processing and fate of Macondo hydrocarbons. Here, we provide an overview of the distribution, fate and impacts of Macondo hydrocarbons and offer suggestions for future research to push the field of oil spill response research forward.

Large quantities of natural gas spewed into the environment for similar to 2 days before the well self-sealed through down-hole collapse below the seafloor. Ecosystem Impacts of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) and collaborating Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) consortia mounted a rapid response cruise to characterize the waters around the Hercules 265 rig, beginning just 4 days after the blowout. Our analysis showed an immediate microbial response to the elevated concentrations of methane in the water column, as evidenced by the drawdown of oxygen to hypoxic conditions, the incorporation of methane-derived carbon into particles, and measurable rates of methane-assimilation and nitrogen-fixation. Additionally, radium isotope measurements allowed us to constrain the timescale of bottom water exposure to the influence of the rig. A second sampling by the Center for Integrated Modeling and Analysis of Gulf Ecosystems (C-IMAGE) consortium indicated that the ecosystem had returned to near pre-blowout conditions within one month.

      "Abstract Note" : "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released a large volume of C-13 and radiocarbon depleted organic matter to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of petroleum-derived carbon entering the offshore planktonic foodweb, as well as widespread oiling of coastal areas documented in previous studies suggests that hydrocarbons could have entered the near shore foodweb. To test this hypothesis, we measured radiocarbon (Delta C-14%) and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in an assortment of fish tissue, invertebrate tissue and shell samples collected within a year of the spill at seven sites from Louisiana to Florida USA across the northern Gulf of Mexico. We observed a west-east gradient with the most depleted radiocarbon values found in Terrebonne Bay, Louisana and increasingly enriched radiocarbon values in organisms collected at sites to the east. Depleted radiocarbon values as low as - 10% in invertebrate soft tissue from Terrebonne suggest assimilation of fossil carbon (2.8 +/- 1.2%), consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter from petrochemical reservoirs released during the Deepwater Horizon spill entered the coastal food web to a limited extent. Further there was a significant correlation between radiocarbon and delta C-13 values in invertebrate tissue consistent with this hypothesis. Both oyster tissue and hard head catfish tissue collected in impacted areas of coastal Louisiana were significantly depleted in C-14 and C-13 relative to organisms collected in the unaffected Apalachicola Bay, Florida (p < 0.014). Alternative explanations for these results include the influence of chronic hydrocarbon pollution along the western gulf coast or that the organisms ingest carbon derived from C-14 depleted organic matter mobilized during the erosion of coastal marshes in southern Louisiana.

Observations were made in September 2011 at water depths of 65-75 m in the Pinnacle Reef trend area offshore from Mississippi and Alabama, Gulf of Mexico, using a digital macro camera deployed from an ROV to examine the coral populations for injury at two principal sites: Alabama Alps Reef (AAR) and Roughtongue Reef (RTR). Taxa observed to exhibit injury included gorgonian octocorals Hypnogorgia pendula, Bebtyce spp., Thesea nivea, and Swiftia exserta, the antipatharian Anti-pathes atlantica, and the sea whips Stichopathes sp., and Ellisella barbadensis. The most common type of injury was a biofilm with a clumped or flake-like appearance covering sea-fan branches. Extreme injuries were characterized by bare skeletons, broken and missing branches. Comparing the 2011 results to previous photo surveys of the same study sites between 1997 and 1999, we found significantly more occurrences of injury in 2011 among taxa with growth forms > 0.5 m. We hypothesize that Tropical Storm Bonnie facilitated and accelerated the mixing process of dispersant-treated hydrocarbons into the water column, resulting in harmful contact with coral colonies at mesophotic depths. Analysis of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (tPAH) concentrations in sediments at AAR and RTR found levels elevated above pre-discharge values, but orders of magnitude below toxicity thresholds established for fauna in estuarine sediments. The tPAH concentrations measured in octocoral and echinoderm tissue samples from AAR and RTR were detectable (mean values ranged from 51 to 345 ppb); however, bioeffect thresholds do not currently exist with which to evaluate the potential harm these levels may cause. Our findings indicate that coral injuries observed in 2011 may have resulted from an acute, isolated event rather than ongoing natural processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Analysis of the magnitude of oil discharged from natural hydrocarbon seeps can improve understanding of the carbon cycle and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) ecosystem. With use of a large archive of remote sensing data, in combination with geophysical and multibeam data, we identified, mapped, and characterized natural hydrocarbon seeps in the Macondo prospect region near the wreck site of the drill-rig Deepwater Horizon (DWH). Satellite image processing and the cluster analysis revealed locations of previously undetected seep zones. Including duplicate detections, a total of 562 individual gas plumes were also observed in multibeam surveys. In total, SAR imagery confirmed 52 oil-producing seep zones in the study area. In almost all cases gas plumes were associated with oil-producing seep zones. The cluster of seeps in the vicinity of lease block MC302 appeared to host the most persistent and prolific oil vents. Oil slicks and gas plumes observed over the DWH site were consistent with discharges of residual oil from the wreckage. In contrast with highly persistent oil seeps observed in the Green Canyon and Garden Banks lease areas, the seeps in the vicinity of Macondo Prospect were intermittent. The difference in the number of seeps and the quantity of surface oil detected in Green Canyon was almost two orders of magnitude greater than in Mississippi Canyon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "Satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was used to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude of the chronic hydrocarbon discharges described in qualitative pollution reports associated with the production and transportation network of the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The National Response Center (NRCen) oil pollution reports were collected and filtered for the period of 2001 to 2012 to determine which of the reports coincided with archived SAR images. Some of the images covered multiple reports and some of the oil discharges described in one report could be observed in more than one image. In all, 177 reports could be investigated from 137 SAR images collected on or near the corresponding report dates. Further analysis found that oil slicks observed in 66 of these SAR images could be attributed to 67 of the reported incidents. Objective measurements indicated that the area of these transient oil slicks visible in SAR images was, on average, significantly larger than what was reported to the NRCen. The only recurring point source for oil slicks was the former site of the Taylor offshore platform. Here chronic, oil slicks were observed that were consistently much larger than other anthropogenic discharges. The SAR images of floating oil discharged from the Taylor site were verified by visual inspection from a boat and aerial photography. For some of the oil slicks discharged from the Taylor site, the accuracy of SAR images for detecting oil slick areas was validated by comparing SAR results to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. These results show that surveillance by SAR would improve accuracy for estimates of chronic anthropogenic oil pollution, particularly where continuous discharges are on-going.

      "Abstract Note" : "We have compiled and mapped available carbon isotope data from sedimentary organic material sampled from the Gulf of Mexico prior to 2010. These data provide a baseline to which any changes in the Gulf of Mexico after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill can be compared. The mean (+/- 1 sigma) delta C-13 values, relative to PDB, are -21.4 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand (entire Gulf of Mexico), -21.7 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand (shelf sediments), -20.4 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand (deepwater sediments), and -25.2 +/- 4.1 parts per thousand (seep-affected sediments). We compare pre-spill mean delta C-13 values to carbon isotope measurements of sedimentary organic material from coretop samples collected after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The differences between the mean compiled delta C-13 values and the post-spill delta C-13 values are corroborated by qualitative relationships with the concentration of poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a proxy for oil contamination, in the sediment. The relationships between delta C-13 of the sedimentary organic material and PAH concentrations allow estimation of background levels of PAHs on the shelf and in the deep Gulf of Mexico. Higher background levels of PAH on the shelf likely relate to Mississippi River outflow and its deposition of petrogenic PAH in riverine sediments. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This research demonstrates that a marketing claim placed on a package is more believable than a marketing claim placed in an advertisement. In three studies, we show that the benefit of greater believability for packages is driven by perceptions of proximity. In general, consumers perceive packages, and thus the claims they offer, as closer to the product than ads and their respective claims. This perception of greater claim-to-product proximity is likely to make a claim seem more verifiable. Therefore, claim-to-product proximity is taken as a signal of the marketers' credibility, decreasing inferences of manipulative intent and thereby increasing claim believability and purchase likelihood.

      "Abstract Note" : "Environmental sustainability is one of the great challenges of the 21st century. A number of explanations have been advanced for why some local governments make strong commitments to sustainability while others do not. Most of the extant empirical research, however, has relied on models that employ only one or just a few of these explanations. As a result, empirical analyses do not encompass a comprehensive set of variables that account for alternative explanations. This study begins to fill this lacuna by specifying an empirical model that examines six explanations for local commitment towards sustainability: local sustainability priorities, regional governance, climate protection networks, interest group support, local fiscal capacity, and characteristics of the local governing institution. Moreover, we use the designation of human and financial resources specifically for sustainability to operationalise commitment. This is a more substantive measure than has been used in previous studies. We accomplish this by utilising data from the Integrated City Sustainability Database. Our results indicate that local priorities, participation in regional governance, and membership in climate protection networks influence the likelihood of cities' devotion of resources to sustainability. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Inhibition of striated muscle contraction at resting Ca2+ depends on the C-terminal half of troponin I (Tnl) in thin filaments. Much focus has been on a short inhibitory peptide (Ip) sequence within TnI, but structural studies and identification of disease-associated mutations broadened emphasis to include a larger mobile domain (Md) sequence at the C-terminus of TnI. For Md to function effectively in muscle relaxation, tight mechanical coupling to troponin's core-and thus tropomyosin-is presumably needed. We generated recombinant, human cardiac troponins containing one of two Tnl constructs: either an 8 amino acid linker between Md and the rest of troponin (cTn(Link8)), or an Md deletion (cTnI(1-163)). Motility assays revealed that Ca2+-sensitivity of reconstituted thin filament sliding was markedly increased with cTnI(Link8) (similar to 0.9 pCa unit leftward shift of speed-pCa relation compared to WT), and increased further when Md was missing entirely (similar to 1.4 pCa unit shift). Cardiac Tn's ability to turn off filament sliding at diastolic Ca2+ was mostly (61%), but not completely eliminated with cTnI(1-163). TnI's Md is required for full inhibition of unloaded filament sliding, although other portions of troponin-presumably including Ip-are also necessary. We also confirm that TnI's Md is not responsible for superactivation of actomyosin cycling by troponin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The C-terminal region of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is known to be important in cardiac function, as removal of the last 17 C-terminal residues of human cTnI has been associated with myocardial stunning. To investigate the C-terminal region of cTnl, three C-terminal deletion mutations in human cTnl were generated: Delta 1 (deletion of residue 210), Delta 3 (deletion of residues 208-210), and Delta 5 (deletion of residues 206-210). Mammalian two-hybrid studies showed that the interactions between cTnl mutants and cardiac troponin C (cTnC) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) were impaired in Delta 3 and Delta 5 mutants when compared to wild-type cTnl. Troponin complexes containing 2-[4'-(iodoacetamido) anilinol naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS) labeled cTnC showed that the troponin complex containing cTnI Delta 5 had a small increase in Ca2+ affinity (P < 0.05); while the cTnl Delta 1- and Delta 3 troponin complexes showed no difference in Ca2+ affinity when compared to wild-type troponin. In vitro motility assays showed that all truncation mutants had increased Ca2+ dependent motility relative to wild-type cTnI. These results suggest that the last 5 C-terminal residues of cTnI influence the binding of cTnl with cTnC and cTnT and affect the Ca2+ dependence of filament sliding, and demonstrate the importance of this region of cTnI.

      "Abstract Note" : "Higher affinity for TnI explains how troponin C (TnC) carrying a causative hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation, TnC(A8V), sensitizes muscle cells to Ca2+. Muscle fibers reconstituted with TnC(A8V) require similar to 2.3-fold less [Ca2+] to achieve 50% maximum-tension compared to fibers reconstituted with wild-type TnC (TnC(WT)). Binding measurements rule out a significant change in N-terminus Ca2+-affinity of isolated TnC(A8V), and TnC(A8V) binds the switch-peptide of troponin-I (TnI(sP)) similar to 1.6-fold more strongly than TnC(WT); thus we model the TnC TnI(SP) interaction as competing with the TnI-actin interaction. Tension data are well-fit by a model constrained to conditions in which the affinity of TnC(A8V) for TnI(SP) is 1.5-1.7-fold higher than that of TnC(WT) at all [Ca2+]. Mean ATPase rates of reconstituted cardiac myofibrils is greater for TnC(A8V) than TnC(WT) at all [Ca2+], with statistically significant differences in the means at higher [Ca2+]. To probe TnC-TnI interaction in low Ca2+, displacement of bis-ANS from TnI was monitored as a function of TnC. Whereas Ca2+-TnC(WT) displaces significantly more bis-ANS than Mg2+-TnC(WT), Ca2+-ThCA8V displaces probe equivalently to Mg2+-TnC(A8V) and Ca2+-TnC(WT), consistent with stronger Ca2+-independent TnC(A8V)-TnI(SP). A Matlab program for computing theoretical activation is reported. Our work suggests that contractility is constantly above normal in hearts made hypertrophic by TnC(A8V). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "The current study employed a meta-analytic approach to investigate the relative importance of component reading skills to reading comprehension in struggling adult readers. A total of 10 component skills were consistently identified across 16 independent studies and 2,707 participants. Random effects models generated 76 predictor-reading comprehension effect sizes among the 10 constructs. The results indicated that six of the component skills exhibited strong relationships with reading comprehension (average rs .50): morphological awareness, language comprehension, fluency, oral vocabulary knowledge, real word decoding, and working memory. Three of the component skills yielded moderate relationships with reading comprehension (average rs .30 and < .50): pseudoword decoding, orthographic knowledge, and phonological awareness. Rapid automatized naming (RAN) was the only component skill that was weakly related to reading comprehension (r = .15). Morphological awareness was a significantly stronger correlate of reading comprehension than phonological awareness and RAN. This study provides the first attempt at a systematic synthesis of the recent research investigating the reading skills of adults with low literacy skills, a historically understudied population. Directions for future research, the relation of our results to the children's literature, and the implications for researchers and adult basic education programs are discussed.",

This investigation sought to extend previous knowledge by providing information about how ADHD and homework behavior (i.e., completing homework regularly) may jointly influence reading comprehension. Using a genetically sensitive design, this study examined the genetic and environmental influences on and between ADHD, homework behavior and reading comprehension. Participants for this study included 691 twin pairs (351 monozygotic, 340 same-sex dizygotic) from the Florida Twin Project on Behavior and Environment (FTP-BE) and 2647 twin pairs (865 monozygotic, 1782 dizygotic) from the larger Florida Twin Project on Reading (FTP-R) in Grades 3 through 7. Three separate models, each representing a different definition of ADHD (full ADHD, inattention only, and hyperactivity/impulsivity only), showed similar patterns of results; therefore, results of the full ADHD model are discussed. Overlapping genetic influences were found between ADHD, homework behavior, and reading comprehension, but no shared environmental influences among all three. However, shared environmental influences overlapped between homework behavior and reading comprehension. Although the sources of this environmental overlap are unknown, these results have implications for improving homework practices and their subsequent influence on literacy skills through homework environments.",

We introduce the statistical technique of multiple quantile regression, which enabled us to assess the predictive utility of morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge at multiple points (quantiles) along the continuous distribution of reading comprehension. To demonstrate the efficacy of our multiple quantile regression analysis, we compared and contrasted our results with a traditional multiple regression analytic approach. Our results indicated that morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge accounted for a large portion of the variance (82%-95%) in reading comprehension skills across all quantiles. Morphological awareness exhibited the greatest unique predictive ability at lower levels of reading comprehension whereas vocabulary knowledge exhibited the greatest unique predictive ability at higher levels of reading comprehension. These results indicate the utility of using multiple quantile regression to assess trajectories of component skills across multiple levels of reading comprehension. The implications of our findings for ABE programs are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Numerous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of spin-lattice relaxation times (T-1S) for dilute spins such as C-13 have led to investigations of the motional dynamics of individual functional groups in solid materials. In this work, we revisit the Solomon equations and analyze how the heteronuclear cross relaxation between the dilute S (e.g. C-13) and abundant I (e.g. H-1) spins affects the measured T-1S values in solid-state NMR in the absence of H-1 saturation during the recovery time. It is found theoretically that at the beginning of the S spin magnetization recovery, the existence of non-equilibrium I magnetization introduces the heteronuclear cross relaxation effect onto the recovery of the S spin magnetization and confirmed experimentally that such a heteronuclear cross relaxation effect results in the recovery overshoot phenomena for the dilute spins when T-1S is on the same order of T-1H, leading to inaccurate measurements of the T-1S values. Even when T-1S is ten times larger than T-1H, the heteronuclear cross relaxation effect on the measured T-1S values is still noticeable. Furthermore, this cross relaxation effect on recovery trajectory of the S spins can be manipulated and even suppressed by preparing the initial I and S magnetization, so as to obtain the accurate T-1S values. A sample of natural abundance L-isoleucine powder has been used to demonstrate the T-1S measurements and their corresponding measured T-1C values under various experimental conditions.

      "Abstract Note" : "As part of the ITER conductor qualification process, 3 m long cable-in-conduit conductors (CICCs) were tested at the SULTAN facility under conditions simulating ITER operation so as to establish the current-sharing temperature, T-cs, as a function of multiple full Lorentz force loading cycles. After a comprehensive evaluation of both the toroidal field (TF) and the central solenoid (CS) conductors, it was found that T-cs degradation was common in long twist pitch TF conductors while short twist pitch CS conductors showed some T-cs increase. However, one kind of TF conductors containing superconducting strand fabricated by the Bochvar Institute of Inorganic Materials (VNIINM) avoided T-cs degradation despite having long twist pitch. In our earlier metallographic autopsies of long and short twist pitch CS conductors, we observed a substantially greater transverse strand movement under Lorentz force loading for long twist pitch conductors, while short twist pitch conductors had negligible transverse movement. With help from the literature, we concluded that the transverse movement was not the source of T-cs degradation but rather an increase of the compressive strain in the Nb3Sn filaments possibly induced by longitudinal movement of the wires. Like all TF conductors this TF VNIINM conductor showed large transverse motions under Lorentz force loading, but T-cs actually increased, as in all short twist pitch CS conductors. We here propose that the high surface roughness of the VNIINM strand may be responsible for the suppression of the compressive strain enhancement (characteristic of long twist pitch conductors). It appears that increasing strand surface roughness could improve the performance of long twist pitch CICCs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The ChoosingWisely (R) initiative is a national campaign led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, focused on quality improvement and advancing a dialogue on avoiding wasteful or unnecessary medical tests, procedures, and treatments. The American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) Prevention Practice Committee is an active participant in the Choosing Wisely project. The committee created the ACPM Choosing Wisely Task Force to lead the development of ACPM's recommendations with the intention of facilitating wise decisions about the appropriate use of preventive care. After utilizing an iterative process that involved reviewing evidence-based literature, the ACPM Choosing Wisely Task Force developed five recommendations targeted toward overused services within the field of preventive medicine. These include: (1) don't take a multivitamin, vitamin E, or beta carotene to prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer; (2) don't routinely perform prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer; (3) don't use whole-body scans for early tumor detection in asymptomatic patients; (4) don't use expensive medications when an equally effective and lower-cost medication is available; and (5) don't perform screening for cervical cancer in low-risk women aged 65 years or older and in women who have had a total hysterectomy for benign disease. The Task Force also reviewed some of the barriers to implementing these recommendations, taking into account the interplay between system and environmental characteristics, and identified specific strategies necessary for timely utilization of these recommendations.

      "Abstract Note" : "The model minority image is a common and pervasive stereotype that Asian American adolescents must navigate. Using multiwave data from 159 adolescents from Asian American backgrounds (mean age at initial recruitment = 15.03, SD = .92; 60 % female; 74 % US-born), the current study targeted unexplored aspects of the model minority experience in conjunction with more traditionally measured experiences of negative discrimination. When examining normative changes, perceptions of model minority stereotyping increased over the high school years while perceptions of discrimination decreased. Both experiences were not associated with each other, suggesting independent forms of social interactions. Model minority stereotyping generally promoted academic and socioemotional adjustment, whereas discrimination hindered outcomes. Moreover, in terms of academic adjustment, the model minority stereotype appears to protect against the detrimental effect of discrimination. Implications of the complex duality of adolescents' social interactions are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Daily consumption of 50 g of dried plum (equivalent to 5-6 dried plums) for 6 months may be as effective as 100 g of dried plum in preventing bone loss in older, osteopenic postmenopausal women. To some extent, these results may be attributed to the inhibition of bone resorption with the concurrent maintenance of bone formation. The objective of our current study was to examine the possible dose-dependent effects of dried plum in preventing bone loss in older osteopenic postmenopausal women. Forty-eight osteopenic women (65-79 years old) were randomly assigned into one of three treatment groups for 6 months: (1) 50 g of dried plum; (2) 100 g of dried plum; and (3) control. Total body, hip, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) were evaluated at baseline and 6 months using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Blood biomarkers including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP-5b), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and sclerostin were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D were measured at baseline and 6 months. Both doses of dried plum were able to prevent the loss of total body BMD compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). TRAP-5b, a marker of bone resorption, decreased at 3 months and this was sustained at 6 months in both 50 and 100 g dried plum groups (P < 0.01 and P < 0.04, respectively). Although there were no significant changes in BAP for either of the dried plum groups, the BAP/TRAP-5b ratio was significantly (P < 0.05) greater at 6 months in both dried plum groups whereas there were no changes in the control group. These results confirm the ability of dried plum to prevent the loss of total body BMD in older osteopenic postmenopausal women and suggest that a lower dose of dried plum (i.e., 50 g) may be as effective as 100 g of dried plum in preventing bone loss in older, osteopenic postmenopausal women. This may be due, in part, to the ability of dried plums to inhibit bone resorption. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02325895.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Individuals with obesity often experience unfair treatment because of their body weight. Such experiences are associated with binge eating, but less is known about its association with other eating-related behaviors and whether these relations are specific to discrimination based on weight or extend to other attributions for discrimination. The present research uses a large national sample (N = 5129) to examine whether weight discrimination is associated with diet and meal rhythmicity, in addition to overeating, and whether these associations generalize to nine other attributions for discrimination. We found that in addition to overeating, weight discrimination was associated with more frequent consumption of convenience foods and less regular meal timing. These associations were generally similar across sex, age, and race. Discrimination based on ancestry, gender, age, religion, and physical disability were also associated with overeating, which suggests that overeating may be a general coping response to discrimination. Unfair treatment because of body weight is associated with unhealthy eating-related behaviors, which may be one pathway through which weight discrimination increases risk for weight gain and obesity.

      "Abstract Note" : "Introduction: The role of interpersonal factors has been proposed in various models of eating disorder (ED) psychopathology and treatment. We examined the independent and interactive contributions of two interpersonal-focused personality traits (i.e., social avoidance and insecure attachment) and reassurance seeking in relation to global ED psychopathology and depressive symptoms among women with bulimia nervosa (BN). Method: Participants were 204 adult women with full or subclinical BN who completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. Hierarchical multiple OLS regressions including main effects and interaction terms were used to analyze the data. Results: Main effects were found for social avoidance and insecure attachment in association with global ED psychopathology and depressive symptoms. In addition, two-way interactions between social avoidance and reassurance seeking were observed for both global ED psychopathology and depressive symptoms. In general, reassurance seeking strengthened the association between social avoidance and global ED psychopathology and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of reassurance seeking in psychopathology among women with BN who display personality features characterized by social avoidance.

It examined two categories of support, parental transfers of cash and shared housing, that are known deficits among young children of incarcerated parents and that play important roles in young adult attainment and well-being. Propensity score analyses of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N [Wave3] = 14,023; N [Wave4] = 14,361) revealed that previously incarcerated mothers were less likely to give money and housing support to young adult children, as were previously incarcerated fathers. Some evidence of cross-parent effects was found; a given parent's incarceration may increase the odds of the other parent's financial support and decrease the odds of their housing support. The study confirms that the impact of parental incarceration extends beyond childhood and may disadvantage youths during the transition to adulthood.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The additivity model assumed that field-scale reaction properties in a sediment including surface area, reactive site concentration, and reaction rate can be predicted from field-scale grain-size distribution by linearly adding reaction properties estimated in laboratory for individual grain-size fractions. This study evaluated the additivity model in scaling mass transfer-limited, multi-rate uranyl (U(VI)) surface complexation reactions in a contaminated sediment. Experimental data of rate-limited U(VI) desorption in a stirred flow-cell reactor were used to estimate the statistical properties of the rate constants for individual grain-size fractions, which were then used to predict rate-limited U(VI) desorption in the composite sediment. The result indicated that the additivity model with respect to the rate of U(VI) desorption provided a good prediction of U(VI) desorption in the composite sediment. However, the rate constants were not directly scalable using the additivity model. An approximate additivity model for directly scaling rate constants was subsequently proposed and evaluated. The result found that the approximate model provided a good prediction of the experimental results within statistical uncertainty. This study also found that a gravel-size fraction (2 to 8 mm), which is often ignored in modeling U(VI) sorption and desorption, is statistically significant to the U(VI) desorption in the sediment.",

Regulations are in effect or planned in several developed countries, however, there is no global standard for conducting ERAs. A review of guidelines developed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), European Union European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EU EMEA), and Japan are presented in this paper. The methods of each protocol are compared and contrasted, thereby highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. To further assess the effectiveness of these ERAs, each protocol was carried out using actual concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), a common sulfonamide used as an antibiotic in animals and humans, detected in four US bays. The protocols produce conflicting results regarding the possible influence of SMZ in the selected coastal environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Reliability has a long history as one of the key psychometric properties of a test. However, a given test might not measure people equally reliably. Test scores from some individuals might have considerably greater error than others. This study proposed two approaches using intraindividual variation to estimate test reliability for each person. A simulation study suggested that the parallel tests approach and the structural equation modeling approach recovered the simulated reliability coefficients. Then in an empirical study, where 45 females were measured daily on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) for 45 consecutive days, separate estimates of reliability were generated for each person. Results showed that reliability estimates of the PANAS varied substantially from person to person. The methods provided in this article apply to tests measuring changeable attributes and require repeated measures across time on each individual. This article also provides a set of parallel forms of PANAS.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In the application of the Satorra-Bentler scaling correction, the choices of normal-theory weight matrices (i.e., the model-predicted vs. the sample covariance matrix) in the calculation of the correction remains unclear. Different software programs use different matrices by default. This simulation study investigates the discrepancies due to the weight matrices in the robust chi-square statistics, standard errors, and chi-square-based model fit indexes. This study varies the sample sizes at 100, 200, 500, and 1,000; kurtoses at 0, 7, and 21; and degrees of model misspecification, measured by the population root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), at 0, .03, .05, .08, .10, and .15. The results favor the use of the model-predicted covariance matrix because it results in less false rejection rates under the correctly specified model, as well as more accurate standard errors across all conditions. For the sample-corrected robust RMSEA, comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), 2 matrices result in negligible differences.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Radon flux via diffusion from sediments and other materials may be determined in the laboratory by circulating air through the sample and a radon detector in a closed loop. However, this approach is complicated by the necessity of having to determine the total air volume in the system and accounting for any small air leaks that can arise if using extended measurement periods. We designed a simple open loop configuration that includes a measured mass of wet sediment and water inside a gas-tight reaction flask connected to a drying system and a radon-in-air analyzer. Ambient air flows through two charcoal columns before entering the reaction vessel to eliminate incoming radon. After traveling through the reaction flask, the air passes the drier and the radon analyzer and is then vented. After some time, the radon activity will reach a steady state depending upon the airflow rate. With this approach, the radon flux via diffusion is simply the product of the steady-state radon activity (Bq/m(3)) multiplied by the airflow rate (mL/min). We demonstrated that this setup could produce good results for materials that produce relatively high radon fluxes. We also show that a modified closed system approach, including radon removal of the incoming air by charcoal filtration in a bypass, can produce very good results including samples with very low emission rates.

      "Abstract Note" : "Proponents of life history strategy (LHS) theory propose that it is an explanation of intra-societal non-political violence, such as homicide and assault. Criminologists usually prefer a different explanation: variation in national violent crime rates is a function of differences in social-structural characteristics, such as absolute or relative poverty (socioeconomic inequality). We found that national homicide rates and prevalence of muggings and attacks on people define a strong single criminal violence factor at the national level. We tested the predictive properties of various plausible predictors of this factor and, separately, of national murder rates. Only the two LHS variables (paternal absenteeism and adolescent fertility) predict the complex factor independently, whereas socioeconomic inequality (Gini), IQ GDP, infant mortality, and pathogen prevalence do not. National murder rates are predicted by the two LHS variables and inequality but not by any other variables. This supports LHS theory as an explanation of national differences in criminal violence.

Data were drawn from a baseline assessment of a larger clinical trial. Participants included 332 adult treatment-seeking smokers (473% female; M-age = 38.45; SD = .50; age range: 18-65 years). Results indicated that perceived stress was indirectly related to perceived barriers to smoking cessation, severity of problematic symptoms during past quit attempts, and AIS through negative reinforcement outcome expectancies. These results were evident after accounting for the variance explained by gender, negative affectivity, and alternative outcome expectancies for smoking. The present findings suggest that smokers with greater perceived stress experience greater negative reinforcement smoking expectancies, which in turn, may be related to numerous processes involved in the maintenance of smoking.

In this paper, we develop and investigate some efficient and stable numerical methods for simulating the unconstrained phase field Willmore dynamics and the phase field Willmore dynamics with fixed volume and surface area constraints. The proposed methods can be high-order accurate and are completely explicit in nature, by combining exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta approximations for time integration with spectral discretizations for spatial operators on regular meshes. We also incorporate novel linear operator splitting techniques into the numerical schemes to improve the discrete energy stability. In order to avoid extra numerical instability brought by use of large penalty parameters in solving the constrained phase field Willmore dynamics problem, a modified augmented Lagrange multiplier approach is proposed and adopted. Various numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate accuracy and stability of the proposed methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The propagation of near-atmospheric nitrogen gas entering a liquid helium (LHe) cooled vacuum tube following an accidental loss of vacuum will be strongly influenced by condensation of the gas on the tube wall. Our previous experimental study revealed that in presence of condensation, the propagation speed of the gas front decreases nearly exponentially as the front advances in the tube. In the present paper, the exponential decrease is studied semi-analytically. We reduce the analytical model of the front speed, using assumptions, to show its derivative in the direction of propagation to be proportional to the mass deposition rate near the front. The deposition rate is then obtained at discreet locations along the tube from the condensation heat transfer rate at these locations. We find the deposition rate to diminish nearly exponentially along the tube so that the spatial derivative of the speed will show the same effect. In this special case, the front speed will also fall exponentially along the tube. Within the experimental and procedural uncertainty, the exponential decay length-scale of the mass deposition rate also agrees reasonably with the empirically determined exponential decay length-scale of the propagation speed.

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent research suggests that firefighters experience elevated rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors. The interpersonal theory of suicide may shed light on this finding. This theory postulates that suicidal desire is strongest among individuals experiencing perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and that the combination of suicide desire and acquired capability for suicide is necessary for the development of suicidal behaviors. We tested the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a large sample of current United States firefighters (N=863). Participants completed self-report measures of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, fearlessness about death (FAD; a component of acquired capability), and career suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history. Regression models were used to examine the association between interpersonal theory constructs, career suicidal ideation severity, and the presence of career suicide attempts. In line with theory predictions, the three-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and FAD was significantly associated with career suicide attempts, beyond participant sex. However, findings were no longer significant after accounting for years of firefighter service or age. Contrary to predictions, the two-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness was not significantly related to career suicidal ideation severity. Applications of the theory to firefighters and future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Seawater pH and the availability of carbonate ions are decreasing due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, posing challenges for calcifying marine species. Marine mussels are of particular concern given their role as foundation species worldwide. Here, we document shell growth and calcification patterns in Mytilus californianus, the California mussel, over millennial and decadal scales. By comparing shell thickness across the largest modern shells, the largest mussels collected in the 1960s-1970s and shells from two Native American midden sites (similar to 1000-2420 years BP), we found that modern shells are thinner overall, thinner per age category and thinner per unit length. Thus, the largest individuals of this species are calcifying less now than in the past. Comparisons of shell thickness in smaller individuals over the past 10-40 years, however, do not show significant shell thinning. Given our sampling strategy, these results are unlikely to simply reflect within-site variability or preservation effects. Review of environmental and biotic drivers known to affect shell calcification suggests declining ocean pH as a likely explanation for the observed shell thinning. Further future decreases in shell thickness could have significant negative impacts on M. californianus survival and, in turn, negatively impact the species-rich complex that occupies mussel beds.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The global evolution of calcareous nannofossils during the Campanian-Maastrichtian interval is not fully understood, and nannofossil zonations for the central and South Atlantic Ocean are yet to be constructed. Here, we test the applicability of previous calcareous nannofossil zonations developed for other ocean basins, for biostratigraphy in the South Atlantic Ocean, and refine Campanian-Maastrichtian biostratigraphy in the region. We document calcareous nannofossil distributions at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites from the high, mid and low latitudes in the South Atlantic Ocean (DSDP Sites 354, 356, 511, 525A, and 530A, and ODP Sites 690C; 700B; 661A, and 1258A). Combining nannofossil occurrences with magnetostratigraphic schemes previously constructed for some of the sites, we propose three new zonations tied to the global magnetostratigraphic chrons, with distinct bio-horizons selected at different latitudinal regions. In this study we present detailed definitions of new South Atlantic Ocean Low-latitude (SAL), South Atlantic Mid latitude (SAM) and South Atlantic High-latitude (SAH) zonations. We identified significant diachronism of some species between latitudes throughout the Campanian and Maastrichtian. These species diachronism, mainly between zonal markers from low and mid latitudes during the late Maastrichtian, was probably related to migration patterns due to fundamental paleoceanographic changes.

However, a technique for depositing large-area, crack-free monolayers on solid substrates is lacking. Herein is presented a method for accomplishing this. Spherical gold nanoparticles were synthesized as an aqueous dispersion. Assembly into monolayers and ligand exchange occurred simultaneously at an organic/aqueous interface. Then the monolayer film was deposited onto arbitrary solid substrates by slowly pumping out the lower, aqueous phase. This allowed the monolayer film (and liquid-liquid interface) to descend without significant disturbance, eventually reaching substrates contained in the aqueous phase. The resulting macroscopic quality of the films was found to be superior to films transferred by Langmuir techniques. The surface plasmon resonance and Raman enhancement of the films were evaluated and found to be uniform across the surface of each film.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) aims to expand the pace and scale of forest restoration on national forests in the United States. The program requires candidate projects to develop landscape-scale forest restoration proposals through a collaborative process and continue to collaborate throughout planning, implementation, and monitoring. Our comparative case analysis of the initial selected projects examines how existing collaborative groups draw on past experience of collaboration and the requirements of a new mandate to shape collaborative structures as they undertake CFLRP work. While mandating collaboration appears contrary to what is often defined as an informal and emergent process, mandates can encourage stakeholder engagement and renew commitment to overcome past conflict. Our findings also suggest that a collaborative mandate can lead to increased attention and scrutiny, prompting adjustments to collaborative process and structure. As such, mandating collaboration creates dynamic tensions between past experience and new requirements for collaborative practice.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We present a rapid approach for forming monodisperse silica microcapsules decorated with metal oxide nanoparticles; the silica-metal oxide composites have a hierarchical architecture and a range of compositions. The details of the method were defined using titania precursors. Silica capsules containing low concentrations of titania (<1 wt. %) were produced via an interfacial reaction using a simple mesofluidic T-junction droplet generator. Increasing the titania content of the capsules was achieved using two related, flow-based postsynthetic approaches. In the first approach, a precursor solution containing titanium alkoxides was flowed through a packed-bed of capsules. The second approach provided the highest concentration of titania (3.5 wt. %) and was achieved by evaporating titanium precursor solutions onto a capsule packed-bed using air flow to accelerate evaporation. Decorated capsules, regardless of the method, were annealed to improve the titania crystallinity and analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The photocatalytic properties were then compared to a commercial nanoparticulate titania, which the microcapsule-supported titania outperformed in terms of rate of degradation of an organic dye and recyclability. Finally, the generality of the flow-based surface decoration procedures was demonstrated by synthesizing several composite transition metal oxide-silica microparticle materials.",

      "Abstract Note" : "An Abstraction Network is a compact summary of an ontology's structure and content. In previous research, we showed that Abstraction Networks support quality assurance (QA) of biomedical ontologies. The development of an Abstraction Network and its associated QA methodologies, however, is a laborintensive process that previously was applicable only to one ontology at a time. To improve the efficiency of the Abstraction-Network-based QA methodology, we introduced a QA framework that uses uniform Abstraction Network derivation techniques and QA methodologies that are applicable to whole families of structurally similar ontologies. For the family-based framework to be successful, it is necessary to develop a method for classifying ontologies into structurally similar families. We now describe a structural meta-ontology that classifies ontologies according to certain structural features that are commonly used in the modeling of ontologies (e.g., object properties) and that are important for Abstraction Network derivation. Each class of the structural meta-ontology represents a family of ontologies with identical structural features, indicating which types of Abstraction Networks and QA methodologies are potentially applicable to all of the ontologies in the family. We derive a collection of 81 families, corresponding to classes of the structural meta-ontology, that enable a flexible, streamlined family based QA methodology, offering multiple choices for classifying an ontology. The structure of 373 ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal is analyzed and each ontology is classified into multiple families modeled by the structural meta-ontology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "Scott Sehon recently argued that the standard notion of determinism employed in the Consequence Argument makes it so that, if our world turns out to be deterministic, then an interventionist God is logically impossible. He further argues that because of this, we should revise our notion of determinism. In this paper I show that Sehon's argument for the claim that the truth of determinism, in this sense, would make an interventionist God logically impossible ultimately fails. I then offer and respond to a weaker version of the argument for the claim that we should revise our notion of determinism.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Functionalization is critical for improving mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/polymer nanocomposites. A fundamental understanding of the role of the CNT/polymer interface and bonding structure is key to improving functionalization procedures for higher mechanical performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chemical functionalization on the nanocomposite interface at atomic resolution to provide direct and quantifiable information of the interactions and interface formation between CNT surfaces and adjacent resin molecules. We observed and compared electronic structures and their changes at the interfaces of nonfunctionalized and functionalized CNT/polymer nanocomposite samples via scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum imaging techniques. The results show that the state of sp(2) bonding and its distribution at the CNT/resin interface can be clearly visualized through EELS mapping. We found that the functionalized CNT/polymer samples exhibited a lower fraction of sp2 bonding and a lower pi(star)/sigma(star) ratio compared with the nonfunctionalized cases. A good correlation between near-edge fine structures and low-loss plasmon energies was observed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recently, the robustification of principal component analysis (PCA) has attracted lots of attention from statisticians, engineers, and computer scientists. In this work, we study the type of outliers that are not necessarily apparent in the original observation space but can seriously affect the principal sub-space estimation. Based on a mathematical formulation of such transformed outliers, a novel robust orthogonal complement principal component analysis (ROC-PCA) is proposed. The framework combines the popular sparsity-enforcing and low-rank regularization techniques to deal with row-wise outliers as well as element-wisp outliers. A nonasymptotic oracle inequality guarantees the accuracy and high breakdown performance of ROC-PCA in finite samples. To tackle the computational challenges, an efficient algorithm is developed on the basis of Stiefel manifold optimization and iterative thresholding. Furthermore, a batch variant is proposed to significantly reduce the cost in ultra high dimensions. The article also points out a pitfall of a common practice of singular value decomposition (SVD) reduction in robust PCA. Experiments show the effectiveness and, efficiency of ROC-PCA in both synthetic and real data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",

      "Abstract Note" : "When perceiving a dangerous predation threat, mammalian and other species activate antipredator defensive reactions. These include the seemingly paradoxical-but compatible-activation of overarousal (e.g., agitation, insomnia) and \"shutdown\" (e.g., mutism, withdrawal) states. Acute suicidal crises, too, are characterized by the co-occurrence of overarousal and shutdown behaviors. In the minutes, hours, and days prior to one's death by suicide, it is not uncommon for one to be simultaneously agitated and socially withdrawn, states that resemble antipredator defensive reactions. In this article, we present empirical, clinical, and philosophical grist for our conjecture that antipredator defensive reactions may serve as a useful way to understand the phenomenology of a serious suicidal crisis, and we reflect on the implications that soon-to-be suicide decedents are simultaneously killer and victim.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Whereas a triple vulnerability model has been used to evaluate several anxiety- and mood-related conditions, no research has purposefully examined hoarding from this perspective. Method: Using a multivariate approach, the current study evaluated the unique relations between hoarding and a general biological (e.g., neuroticism), psychological (e.g., anxiety sensitivity), and hoarding-specific vulnerability (e.g., saving cognitions) within 526 individuals. Results: A structural equation model (SEM) including all three vulnerabilities as well as hoarding symptoms provided good fit to the data. Consistent with the model, the vulnerabilities accounted for a substantial percentage (66%) of the variance in hoarding severity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, similar to other emotional distress disorders, risk for hoarding can be conveyed through a constellation of general and specific vulnerabilities. Future research should continue to examine this model, particularly utilizing a prospective design and clinical sample.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Reliabilities of scores for experimental tasks are likely to differ from one study to another to the extent that the task stimuli change, the number of trials varies, the type of individuals taking the task changes, the administration conditions are altered, or the focal task variable differs. Given that reliabilities vary as a function of the design of these tasks and the characteristics of the individuals taking them, making inferences about the reliability of scores in an ongoing study based on reliability estimates from prior studies is precarious. Thus, it would be advantageous to estimate reliability based on data from the ongoing study. We argue that internal consistency estimates of reliability are underutilized for experimental task data and in many applications could provide this information using a single administration of a task. We discuss different methods for computing internal consistency estimates with a generalized coefficient alpha and the conditions under which these estimates are accurate. We illustrate use of these coefficients using data for three different tasks.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Why are some developing countries less open to technical election assistance than to election observation? My argument about who seeks and receives technical election assistance is two-fold, taking into account the incentives of recipients and providers. On the recipient side, governments are less likely to request technical assistance when the political costs are high (autocracy) or the benefits low (strong electoral institutions). On the provider side, international organizations are less likely to provide such technical assistance when the government appears to lack political will for reform and full project implementation is unlikely. Statistical analyses of global data on technical election assistance by the United Nations covering 130 countries from 1990 to 2003 support this argument about political cost-benefit calculations in considering technical assistance. Case examples from Guyana, Indonesia, Haiti, and Venezuela illustrate some of these dynamics. My findings suggest that seemingly complementary international interventions (observation and technical support) can create different incentives for domestic and international actors. This helps explain why some countries tend to agree more often to election observation than to technical election assistance.",

Using 3 longitudinal samples, this study examined whether subjective age predicts hospitalization among older adults. Method: Participants were adults aged from 24 to 102 years old, drawn from the 1995-1996 and 2004-2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS, N = 3209), the 2008 and 2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, N = 3779), and the 2011 and 2013 waves of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS, N = 3418). In each sample, subjective age and covariates were assessed at baseline and hospitalization was assessed at follow-up. Results: Consistent across the 3 samples, participants who felt subjectively older at baseline had an increased likelihood of hospitalization (combined effect size: 1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23), controlling for age, sex, race, and education. Further adjusting for disease burden and depression reduced the magnitude of the association between subjective age and hospitalization in the 3 samples, but it remained significant in the MIDUS and HRS. Conclusion: This study provides consistent evidence that subjective age predicts incident hospitalization. Subjective age assessment can help identify individuals at greater risk of hospitalization, who may benefit from prevention and intervention efforts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been associated with elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the extant literature. However, no research to date has investigated whether pre-trauma IU predicts PTSS following trauma exposure. The current study prospectively examined the relationship between IU and PTSS within a sample of individuals with various levels of exposure to a university campus shooting. We hypothesized that pre-trauma IU would predict elevated PTSS following a campus shooting, even after covarying for anxiety sensitivity (AS), a known correlate of PTSS. Participants included undergraduates (n = 77) who completed a self-report battery in Introductory Psychology. After a campus shooting, they were invited to complete measures of PTSD symptoms and level of exposure to the shooting. As anticipated, results revealed pre-trauma IU as a significant predictor of elevated PTSS following the campus shooting. These results remained significant after covarying for pre-trauma levels of AS. Our results are the first to demonstrate that elevated pre-trauma levels of IU predict later PTSS following exposure to a traumatic event. This finding is discussed in terms of promising directions for future research and treatment strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Loss of ability of the left upper limb (LUL) to correctly produce spatial and temporal components of skilled purposeful movements was reported 34years ago in a woman with a callosal infarction. To learn about recovery, we recently reexamined this woman. This woman was tested for ideomotor apraxia by asking her to pantomime to command and to seeing pictures of tools. Whereas she performed normally with her right upper limb, her LUL remained severely apraxic, making many spatial (postural and movement) errors. Initially, she did not reveal loss of finger-hand deftness (limb-kinetic apraxia), and when tested again with the coin rotation task, her left hand performance was normal. Without vision, she could name objects placed in her left hand but not name numbers written in this hand. Since this woman had a callosal lesion, failure to recover cannot be accounted for by left hemisphere inhibition of her right hemisphere. Although failure for her LUL to improve may have been related to not using her LUL for skilled actions, her right hemisphere was able to observe transitive actions, and this failure of her LUL to produce skilled purposeful movements suggests her right hemisphere may have not had the capacity to learn these movement representations. Without vision, her ability to recognize objects with her left hand, but not numbers written on her left palm, suggests graphesthesia may require that her left hand did not have access to movement representations important for programming these numbers when writing.",

      "Abstract Note" : "An asymmetric one-mode data matrix has rows and columns that correspond to the same set of objects. However, the roles of the objects frequently differ for the rows and the columns. For example, in a visual alphabetic confusion matrix from an experimental psychology study, both the rows and columns pertain to letters of the alphabet. Yet the rows correspond to the presented stimulus letter, whereas the columns refer to the letter provided as the response. Other examples abound in psychology, including applications related to interpersonal interactions (friendship, trust, information sharing) in social and developmental psychology, brand switching in consumer psychology, journal citation analysis in any discipline (including quantitative psychology), and free association tasks in any subarea of psychology. When seeking to establish a partition of the objects in such applications, it is overly restrictive to require the partitions of the row and column objects to be identical, or even the numbers of clusters for the row and column objects to be the same. This suggests the need for a biclustering approach that simultaneously establishes separate partitions of the row and column objects. We present and compare several approaches for the biclustering of one-mode matrices using data sets from the empirical literature. A suite of MATLAB m-files for implementing the procedures is provided as a Web supplement with this article.",

Here, we highlight species differences in neurochemical receptor distributions associated with mating experience leading to the establishment of stable pair-bonds. Specifically, we illustrate the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in programming the formation and maintenance of monogamous bonds and describe the role of anterior hypothalamic vasopressin in the regulation of selective aggression. We conclude by discussing recent molecular work in voles and emphasize the importance of this rodent for future research in the behavioral neurobiology field.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Barriers are purposely omitted from the structural analysis for bridge design or load rating. They are not considered as primary structural members because, after a forceful collision, they may sustain some structural damage and would no longer strengthen the bridge deck. However, when completely intact, these secondary structural members do affect the distribution of applied loads, which is of interest to permitting agencies, such as the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). For a prestressed concrete segmental box girder bridge, both design and load rating (for oversized load permits) are determined by longitudinal and transverse analyses without considering the influence of the barriers. For the transverse analysis, the maximum moment generated from the live load is traditionally calculated from Homberg charts. These influence surfaces are based on plate behavior and idealized support conditions and are generally conservative. This moment estimation and the lack of consideration for the barriers create a conservative transverse design and load rating for the bridge. In this study, finite-element bridge models show how much the barrier affects transverse live-load moments on a prestressed concrete segmental box girder bridge. Data obtained from these models were compared with measurements obtained from a FDOT load test and also with predictions made from Homberg influence surfaces, which are often used by engineers in design. The results show that a continuous barrier reduced transverse moments, a jointed barrier behaved more similarly to no barrier, and Homberg design moments were generally conservative. In addition, the joint in the barrier played a large role in transverse live-load effects. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

A phenomenological study examined how parental divorce during emerging adulthood gives meaning to emerging adults' experiences, specifically with regards to support networks and familial relationships. Fifteen females between the ages of 18 and 25 (M = 21.5) whose parents divorced after age 18 were interviewed. Three themes of meaning emerged from the data: emotional consequences of loss and contradictory coping, involvement in the divorce process, and the evolution (or not) of family dynamics. Results are relevant for psychologists, family therapists, and university mental health programs by providing information on how the experience of parental divorce influences emerging adults' state of homeostasis, perceptions of the parent-child relationship, and perceived importance of support systems.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hyperactivity, or excess gross motor activity, is considered a core and ubiquitous characteristic of ADHD. Alternate models question this premise, and propose that hyperactive behavior reflects, to a large extent, purposeful behavior to cope with environmental demands that interact with underlying neurobiological vulnerabilities. The present review critically evaluates the ubiquity and environmental modifiability of hyperactivity in ADHD through meta-analysis of 63 studies of mechanically measured activity level in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD relative to typically developing groups. Random effects models corrected for publication bias confirmed elevated gross motor activity in ADHD (d = 0.86); surprisingly, neither participant age (child vs. adult) nor the proportion of each ADHD sample diagnosed with the inattentive subtype/presentation moderated this effect. In contrast, activity level assessed during high cognitive load conditions in general (d = 1.14) and high executive functioning demands in particular (d = 1.39) revealed significantly higher effect sizes than activity level during low cognitive load (d = 0.36) and in-class schoolwork (d = 0.50) settings. Low stimulation environments, more rigorous diagnostic practices, actigraph measurement of movement frequency and intensity, and ADHD samples that included fewer females were also associated with larger effects. Overall, the results are inconsistent with DSM-5 and ADHD models that a) describe hyperactivity as ubiquitous behavior, b) predict a developmental decline in hyperactivity, or c) differentiate subtypes/presentations according to perceived differences in hyperactive behavior. Instead, results suggest that the presence and magnitude of hyperactive behavior in ADHD may be influenced to a considerable extent by environmental factors in general, and cognitive/executive functioning demands in particular.

      "Abstract Note" : "Wind stress is an important parameter in generating the ocean surface currents. Here, for the first time, we directly estimate this parameter at the ocean surface using all the observations from AltiKa and the accompanying radiometer that affect the wind stress estimates and radar signal propagation through the atmosphere. For this purpose, we used an artificial neural network approach using in situ estimates as the dependent parameter and satellite records as the independent parameters. In the absence of sufficient in situ measurements, wind stress is generally inferred from wind speed at 10-m height obtained from spaceborne scatterometers and altimeters which has been extrapolated to the surface to estimate stress, assuming certain atmospheric conditions that are rarely correct. Hence, we obtained this parameter directly at the ocean surface from satellite records. The estimates for the independent validation data set have a standard deviation of the difference between the in situ and satellite-derived values of 0.032 Nm(-2) with Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.96 significant at 99% confidence level.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Barely visible impact damage in composites can result in hidden damage such as delamination and cracking. Triboluminescence is currently being looked at as a way of inundating composites with a sensory level mechanism for impact events. ZnS:Mn doped resin sensing plates are embedded within glass fiber-reinforced composites and are impacted at low velocities (3.45-3.51m/s). The damage created by the impact can be seen under black light analysis and allows for quick visual inspection of the composite. The striker during impact registers a bounce which can be used to determine final impact velocity, which in turn defines the force at impact. By measuring the amount of time between consecutive impacts, an indirect estimation of impact force was made using the temporal occurrence of triboluminescence. Triboluminescent emissions occurred for impacts greater than 300N. The measured impact energy averaged 36.79J (+/- 0.48). The calculated impact force and impact energy corresponded to the amount of damage area found on the composite, showing that triboluminescent crystal inclusion into composites can provide damage sensing capability to woven fiber composites.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A strong predisposition to engage in sexual intercourse likely evolved in humans because sex is crucial to reproduction. Given that meeting interpersonal preferences tends to promote positive relationship evaluations, sex within a relationship should be positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Nevertheless, prior research has been inconclusive in demonstrating such a link, with longitudinal and experimental studies showing no association between sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction. Crucially, though, all prior research has utilized explicit reports of satisfaction, which reflect deliberative processes that may override the more automatic implications of phylogenetically older evolved preferences. Accordingly, capturing the implications of sexual frequency for relationship evaluations may require implicit measurements that bypass deliberative reasoning. Consistent with this idea, one cross-sectional and one 3-year study of newlywed couples revealed a positive association between sexual frequency and automatic partner evaluations but not explicit satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of automatic measurements to understanding interpersonal relationships.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In most mammals and a rare few reptilian lineages the evolution of precise dental occlusion led to the capacity to form functional chewing surfaces due to pressures generated while feeding. The complex dental architectures of such teeth and the biomechanics of their self-wearing nature are poorly understood. Our research team composed of paleontologists, evolutionary biologists, and engineers have developed a protocol to: (1) determine the histological make-up of grinding dentitions in extant and fossil taxa; (2) ascertain wear-relevant material properties of the tissues; (3) determine how those properties relate to inter-tissue-biomechanics leading the dental functionality using a three-dimensional Archard's wear model developed specifically for dental applications; (4) analyze those data in phylogenetic contexts to infer evolutionary patterns as they relate to feeding. Finally we discuss industrial applications that are emerging from our paleontologically-inspired research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is a special Voronoi tessellation whose generators are also the centers of mass of the corresponding Voronoi regions. The edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (EWCVT) greatly improves the classic CVT model by adding an edge energy term in the energy functional, and has been proven to be very effective and efficient for image segmentation. In this paper, we propose afuzzy edge-weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (FEWCVT) model which, generalizes the EWCVT clustering with fuzzy membership information. The FEWCVT model novelly introduces an edge energy based on fuzzy clustering and naturally combines it into the EWCVT model, and thus appropriately combines the image intensity information with the length of cluster boundaries in a fuzzy form. In its simplest form, FEWCVT model reduces to the classic EWCVT model. An iterative algorithm is proposed for the FEWCVT model based on energy minimization. In the experiments, we apply the FEWCVT method to segment various types of images and also compare it with several existing fuzzy clustering methods to demonstrate its performance.

      "Abstract Note" : "Reduced order modeling (ROM) coupled with finite element methods has been used effectively in many disciplines to efficiently solve complex problems. However, for advection-dominated flows numerical simulations often contain spurious, nonphysical oscillations which will also be apparent in the ROM simulations. In this work we consider stabilization methods for ROM for the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation when it is solved both with and without operator splitting. Specifically we consider the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method and the spurious oscillations at layers diminishing (SOLD) stabilization method. We build on these methods by constructing a coherent framework which successfully integrates these model reduction, stabilization, and operator splitting approaches, and we provide numerical examples detailing the application of this framework in the ADR setting. The stabilized ROM results are compared numerically with their corresponding full finite element simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A stationary Stokes problem with nonlinear rheology and with mixed no-slip and sliding basal boundary conditions is considered. The model describes the flow of ice in glaciers and ice sheets. A least-squares finite element method is developed and analyzed. The method does not require that the finite element spaces satisfy an inf-sup condition. Moreover, the usage of negative Sobolev norm in the least-squares functional allows for the use of standard piecewise polynomials spaces for both the velocity and pressure approximations. A Picard-type iterative method is used to linearize the Stokes problem. It is shown that the linearized least-squares functional is coercive and continuous in an appropriate solution space so the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution immediately follows as do optimal error estimates for finite element approximations. Numerical tests are provided to illustrate the theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents a multi-scale mathematical model of Escherichia calf chemotaxis in a fluid environment that links the biochemical dynamics of intracellular signaling and flagellar dynamics to the behavior of cells and the surrounding nutrients and fluid flow. We combine the RapidCell model for the intracellular chemotaxis signaling pathway to obtain run and tumble behaviors of cells with the method of regularized Stokeslets to simulate cell motility in Stokes flow and the finite element method to solve the advection-diffusion-reaction equation of nutrients. Simulations were carried out using varying numbers of bacterial cells to ascertain the effects of cell-cell and cell-fluid interactions in isotropic environments and in fluids characterized by chemoeffector nutrient gradients. The resulting feedback between hydrodynamics and chemotaxis not only shows expected run and tumble behaviors of bacterial cells but also depicts the importance of fluid dynamical effects on the transport and consumption of chemoeffectors.

      "Abstract Note" : "We propose a novel numerical approach for nonlocal diffusion equations Du et al. (2012) with integrable kernels, based on the relationship between the backward Kolmogorov equation and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) driven by Levy jumps processes. The nonlocal diffusion problem under consideration is converted to a BSDE, for which numerical schemes are developed. As a stochastic approach, the proposed method completely avoids the challenge of iteratively solving non-sparse linear systems, arising from the nature of nonlocality. This allows for embarrassingly parallel implementation and also enables adaptive approximation techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Moreover, our method recovers the convergence rates of classic deterministic approaches (e.g. finite element or collocation methods), due to the use of high-order temporal and spatial discretization schemes. In addition, our approach can handle a broad class of problems with general inhomogeneous forcing terms as long as they are globally Lipschitz continuous. Rigorous error analysis of the new method is provided as several numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "An effective evaluation system can provide specific and practical suggestions to the deep groundwater management. But such kind of evaluation system has not been proposed in China. In this study, an evaluation index system is specifically developed to evaluate deep groundwater management efficiency. It is composed of three first-level indicators (law enforcement capability, management ability, and management effectiveness) and eleven second-level indicators. The second-level indicators include seven mandatory indicators and four optional indicators. Piecewise linear function is used to normalize the quantitative indicators, and expert scoring method and questionnaire survey method are used to normalize the qualitative indicators. Then a comprehensive indicator weighting evaluation method is used to evaluate the first-level indicators and the target topic. A case study is carried out to evaluate deep groundwater management efficiency in Tianjin City. According to the evaluation score in each period, the management efficiency of every district in Tianjin City gradually improved. The overall evaluation score in the early deep groundwater extraction period is 0.12. After a series of deep groundwater protection efforts, this score reached to 0.61 in 2007, and met the regulation criteria. The evaluation results also showed that the further groundwater management efforts in Tianjin City should be focused on building a dynamic database to collect comprehensive deep well-log data; and on a reasonable design and distribution of the groundwater monitoring network. It demonstrated that the index system is suitable to locate the deficiencies of current groundwater management systems and to guide further improvements. It can then be used to protect deep groundwater.",

The 45-T hybrid magnet, consisting of a superconducting outsert and resistive insert, was commissioned in 2000 reaching a field of 45 tesla. The cryogenic system for the NHMFL has been in service since 1994 and has provided cryogenic service for the 45-T hybrid superconducting outsert since testing in 1998. It was recently upgraded, replacing a majority of the original system. The 45-T Hybrid was cooled down successfully with the new cryogenic system in February 2014. The new cryogenic system has been proved more efficient and reliable in the past years, providing increased availability to the users. After the upgrade of the cryogenic system, a standard index heating test was performed on the outsert of the hybrid. This test is mainly for evaluating the performance of the outsert, particularly the degradation of the innermost Nb3Sn coil of the outsert that suffered an unprotected quench in 2000 and degradation since then. The results of index heating tests in the past are compared and presented.",

Older adults with a chronic health condition have been shown to benefit from remote monitoring but often have challenges with complex technology. The current study reports on the usability of and adherence with an integrated, real-time monitoring system over an extended period of time by older adults with and without a chronic health condition. Materials and Methods: Older adults 55 years of age and over with and without heart failure participated in a study in which a telehealth system was used for 6 months each. The system consisted of a wireless wristwatch-based monitoring device that continuously collected temperature and motion data. Other health information was collected daily using a weight scale, blood pressure cuff, and tablet that participants used for health surveys. Data were automatically analyzed and summarized by the system and presented to study nurses. Results: Forty-one older adults participated. Seventy-one percent of surveys, 75% of blood pressure readings, and 81% of daily weight measurements were taken. Participants wore the watch monitor 77% of the overall 24/7 time requested. The weight scale had the highest usability rating in both groups. The groups did not otherwise differ on device usage. Conclusions: The findings indicate that a health monitoring system designed for older adults can and will be used for an extended period of time and may help older adults with chronic conditions reside longer in their own homes in partnership with the healthcare system.",

This study examines developmental trends in adolescents' experiences with the Model Minority Stereotype (MMS) during adolescence, the valence of feelings about the MMS, and the associations between experiences, feelings, and ethnic identity. Survey data were collected annually from 159 Asian American adolescents throughout high school. Results revealed that MMS experiences increased over time, but feelings remained consistent in valence. Experiences and feelings predicted ethnic identity both concurrently and longitudinally, but ethnic identity predicted experiences only concurrently and did not predict the valence of feelings. Discussion focuses on how adolescents' attitudes toward a complex ethnic stereotype may evolve as they establish-or fail to establish-a connection to their cultural background.",

      "Abstract Note" : "DNA replication is essential for faithful transmission of genetic information and is intimately tied to chromosome structure and function. Genome duplication occurs in a defined temporal order known as the replication-timing (RT) program, which is regulated during the cell cycle and development in discrete units referred to as replication domains (RDs). RDs correspond to topologically-associating domains (TADs) and are spatio-temporally compartmentalized in the nucleus. While improvements in experimental tools have begun to reveal glimpses of causality, they have also unveiled complex context-dependent relationships that challenge long recognized correlations of RT to chromatin organization and gene regulation. In particular, RDs/TADs that switch RT during development march to the beat of a different drummer.",

      "Abstract Note" : "High-temperature superconducting (HTS) dc cable is expected to be an application as larger transmission of electrical power because of, ultimately, lower loss, as well as large capacity compared with ac cable. In order to secure long life, reliability, and compactness of HTS DC cable, the roles of breakdown properties and insulation design are important. In actual cable, breakdown properties are influenced by not only up-scale effect but also mechanical stress during cable production and installation. For HTS cable, polypropylene laminated paper has been used as insulation material. Polypropylene laminated paper has been widely adopted as insulating material for HTS cable. In this paper, the model cables with different thicknesses were fabricated, and the breakdown tests were performed. Based on the results, an improved insulation design of 250-kV-class HTS dc cable was proposed with volume effect. The breakdown characteristics of bended cables were also investigated with various testing conditions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Sea level rise (SLR) imposes an increasing flooding hazard on low-lying coastal communities due to higher exposure to high-tide conditions and storm surge. Additional coastal flooding hazard arises due to reduced effectiveness of gravity-based drainage systems to drain rainwater during heavy rain events. Over the past decade, several coastal communities along the US Atlantic coast have experienced an increasing rate of flooding events. In this study, we focus on the increasing flooding hazard in Miami Beach, Florida, which has caused severe property damage and significant disruptions to daily life. We evaluate the flooding frequency and its causes by analyzing tide and rain gauge records, media reports, insurance claims, and photo records from Miami Beach acquired during 1998-2013. Our analysis indicates that significant changes in flooding frequency occurred after 2006, in which rain-induced events increased by 33% and tide-induced events increased by more than 400%. We also analyzed tide gauge records from Southeast Florida and detected a decadal-scale accelerating rates of SLR. The average pre-2006 rate is 3 +/- 2 mm/yr, similar to the global long-term rate of SLR, whereas after 2006 the average rate of SLR in Southeast Florida rose to 9 4 mm/yr. Our results suggest that engineering solutions to SLR should rely on regional SLR rate projections and not only on the commonly used global SLR projections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "We studied the magnetoresistance (MR) of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) on electron transparent substrate. Samples of tBLG were assembled on free-standing silicon nitride (SiNx) membranes (<100 nm thick) by transferring chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown single layer graphene (SLG) twice; this allowed the measurement of the angle of rotation between the two layers, the twist angle, by electron diffraction using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To compare with the previous reports on tBLG, we performed Raman spectroscopy on our samples. We measured the MR of tBLG for two different twist angles: 2 degrees (small) and 18 degrees (large). The MR showed superposition of two Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations for both angles. An analysis of the oscillation peaks by Landau fan diagrams showed difference as twist angle. While the large twist angle (18 degrees) sample had two anomalous pi Berry's phases, the small twist angle (2 degrees) sample had conventional 2 pi and anomalous pi Berry's phase depending on carrier density.

      "Abstract Note" : "The results presented herein include SparkJet characterization studies with a focus on understanding the actuator efficiency during stage 1 and the resulting flowfield. Experimental cavity pressure and arc power measurements are used to estimate efficiency whereas experimental microschlieren images are used to visualize the flowfield and quantify the velocity of distinct flow features. The experimental measurements used to estimate efficiency during stage 1 of a single SparkJet cycle were acquired using a single orifice SparkJet design in a quiescent environment. The experiments evaluated efficiency as a function of cavity volume (42.4-169.6mm3), orifice diameter (0.4-2.0mm), and input energy (0.17-0.77J per pulse). The results show that efficiency is a function of parasitic resistance in circuit components, high-temperature gas dynamics, and the ratio of input energy to internal energy of the cavity air, QC/E. The circuit design used here was approximately 80% efficient and the pressure-based efficiency decreased from 40 to 20% as QC/E increased from 5 to 60. Adjusting the pressure-based efficiency calculation to be a function of the measured arc energy, the conversion from arc energy to the energy available to raise the cavity pressure was 40-45% efficient. Using a SparkJet four-orifice array design (cavity volume of 363mm3 and each orifice 0.4mm in diameter) in a quiescent environment, phase-averaged microschlieren images of a single SparkJet cycle reveal the rapid flow development when the first evidence of flow is seen 8s after the SparkJet initiation and a well-developed jet is visible by 100s. Also based on these calibrated images, the maximum jet velocity was estimated at 250m/s.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Judges sitting on three-judge panels in the U.S. Courts of Appeals make decisions under the shadow of potential review by supervising courts, the full circuit sitting en banc and the Supreme Court. Review is more likely for published decisions, particularly when a dissent is present. Unpublished decisions do not have binding precedential status. These factors create the potential for judges to be strategic in deciding whether to publish a decision or write a dissent. We develop a formal model of decision aggregation that takes the possibility of negotiating a tradeoff between the ideological location of a rule and its precedential value into account. Implications of our model are tested empirically using an original data set of search and seizure cases. Our model and results indicate that preferences within the panel and judicial hierarchy coupled with discretionary review influence judges' decisions regarding publication and dissent, and that these choices have important consequences.",

The purpose of this research was to determine the degree to which age, physical morbidity, anxiety, and hormonal status predict the likelihood of severe depression among women with mood disorders (n = 298). Data arose from a standardized battery of measures in a multi-center clinical registry of patients with mood disorders. The women were being treated at 17 participating sites of the National Network of Depression Centers. Results of logistic regression analyses indicate that a woman's level of anxiety was the strongest predictor of her likelihood of having severe depression (Exp(B) = 1.33, p = .000), including thoughts of death or suicide. The number of physical health problems that a woman reported was also a significant predictor (Exp(B) = 1.09, p = .04). Neither age nor hormonal status was significant in the final model, although a trend was observed for women with surgically induced menopause to have more severe depression. Findings support the need to work closely with medical practitioners to address physical health problems as part of the treatment plan for depression and to give comorbid anxiety and depression equal priority in symptom management.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Anxiety disorders contribute substantially to the overall public health burden of psychopathology. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), a fear of anxiety related sensations, is one of the few known malleable risk factors for anxiety pathology. Previous AS reduction treatments have utilized highly trained clinicians. A completely-computerized AS treatment would reduce costs and increase dissemination possibilities. Cognitive bias modification for interpretation biases (CBM-I) interventions have shown clinically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms. Another emerging literature focused on learning has shown context-shifting tasks can greatly increase learning without adding logistical burden to an intervention. The current study evaluated a CBM-I for AS that utilized a context-shifting task to deliver twice the treatment dose of extant interventions. Design: Single-site randomized controlled trial. Participants completed an intervention appointment, as well as one-week and one-month follow-up assessments. Participants: Individuals with elevated levels of AS. Intervention: Single-session computer-delivered CBM-I for AS. Results: Results indicate that the CBM-I for AS was successful in reducing overall AS (62% post intervention) and these reductions were maintained through one-month post-intervention (64%). Results also revealed that individuals in the active condition reported significantly less incidents of panic responding to a physiological straw-breathing challenge and that change in interpretation bias significantly mediated the relationship between treatment condition and post-treatment AS reductions. Conclusions: Taken together, the results show that the current CBM-I intervention was strong in terms of immediate and one-month AS reductions. Given its brevity, low cost, low stigma and portability, this intervention could have substantial impact on reducing the burden of anxiety disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with lipoproteins, and apolipoprotein E (apoE) plays an essential role in infectious HCV particles. Although the role of apoE in HCV infection is well known, its role in the replication of HCV remains unclear. The aims of this study were to determine the role of apoE in the RNA replication of major HCV genotypes 1b and 2a, and to determine whether this role is HCV-genotype-dependent using HCV genotype 1b replicon cells and HCV genotype 2a producing (HP) cells. HCV infection was blocked in Huh7.5 cells treated with low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoproteins, or apoE3. An apoE3-specific monoclonal antibody also efficiently neutralized HCV infectivity, and HCV infection was dramatically suppressed by the knockdown of apoE expression with an apoE-specific small interfering RNA, suggesting a requirement for apoE in infectious HCV particles. HCV RNA replication was not affected in HP cells treated with each apoE isoform or transfected with apoE-specific siRNAs. However, the knockdown of apoE expression suppressed RNA replication of HCV genotype 1b. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of apoE, apoA1, and apoB expression also suppressed the RNA replication of HCV genotype 1b, but not that of HCV genotype 2a. Taken together, these findings indicate that apoE plays an important role in HCV genotype 2a infection and in HCV genotype 1b RNA replication, but not in the replication of HCV genotype 2a. These results provide important information for the future development of HCV-genotype-specific anti-HCV agents.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common occurrence in the days immediately after premature birth. It has been correlated with outcomes such as periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), cerebral palsy and developmental delay. The causes and evolution of IVH are unclear; it has been associated with fluctuations in blood pressure, damage to the subventricular zone and seizures. At present, ultrasound is the most commonly used method for detection of IVH, but is used retrospectively. Without the presence of adequate therapies to avert IVH, the use of a continuous monitoring technique may be somewhat moot. While treatments to mitigate the damage caused by IVH are still under development, the principal benefit of a continuous monitoring technique will be in investigations into the etiology of IVH, and its associations with periventricular injury and blood pressure fluctuations. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is potentially of use in this context as accumulating blood displaces higher conductivity cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles. We devised an electrode array and EIT measurement strategy that performed well in detection of simulated ventricular blood in computer models and phantom studies. In this study we describe results of pilot in vivo experiments on neonatal piglets, and show that EIT has high sensitivity and specificity to small quantities of blood (<1 ml) introduced into the ventricle. EIT images were processed to an index representing the quantity of accumulated blood (the 'quantity index', QI). We found that QI values were linearly related to fluid quantity, and that the slope of the curve was consistent between measurements on different subjects. Linear discriminant analysis showed a false positive rate of 0%, and receiver operator characteristic analysis found area under curve values greater than 0.98 to administered volumes between 0.5, and 2.0 ml. We believe our study indicates that this method may be well suited to quantitative monitoring of IVH in newborns, simultaneously or interleaved with electroencephalograph assessments.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although computer technology may be particularly useful for older adults (e.g., for communication and information access), they have been slower adopters than their younger counterparts. Perceptions about computers, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, can pose barriers to acceptance and universal access (Davis in MIS Q 13(3):319-340, 1989). Therefore, understanding the precursors to these perceptions for older adult non-computer users may provide insight into the reasons for their non-adoption. The authors examined the relationship between perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a computer interface designed for older users and demographic, technology experience, cognitive abilities, personality, and attitudinal variables in a sample of 300 non-computer-using adults between the ages 64 and 98, selected for being at high risk for social isolation. The strongest correlates of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were technology experience, personality dimensions of agreeableness and openness to experience, and attitudes. The emotional stability personality dimension was significantly correlated with perceived ease of use though not perceived usefulness. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that attitudes (i.e., self-efficacy, comfort, and interest) remained predictive of perceptions of usefulness and ease of use when technology experience and personality variables were accounted for. Given that attitudes are more malleable than other variables, such as demographic and cognitive abilities, these findings highlight the potential to increase technology acceptance through positive experiences, appropriate training, and educational campaigns about the benefits of computers and other technologies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Settlement is critical to maintaining coral cover on reefs, yet interspecific responses of coral planulae to common benthic macroalgae are not well characterized. Larval survival and settlement of two Caribbean reef-building corals, the broadcast-spawner Acropora palmata and the planulae-brooder Porites astreoides, were quantified following exposure to plastic algae controls and the green macroalga Halimeda opuntia. Survival and settlement rates were not significantly affected by the presence of H. opuntia in either species. However, similar to 10 % of P. astreoides larvae settled on the surface of the macroalga, whereas larvae of A. palmata did not. It is unlikely that corals that settle on macroalgae will survive post-settlement; therefore, H. opuntia may reduce the number of P. astreoides and other non-discriminatory larvae that survive to adulthood. Our results suggest that the presence of macroalgae on impacted reefs can have unexpected repercussions for coral recruitment and highlight discrepancies in settlement specificity between corals with distinct life history strategies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Conductor insulation is a key technology for the development of ultrahigh field superconducting magnets. We have developed a ceramic insulation coating on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x round wire for high field magnet applications. The coating consists of TiO2 nanopowder, polymer binders, and other additives. The insulation is uniformly applied on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x wire by dip coating in ceramic slurries. Its thickness is controllable between 10 and 30 mu m. The coating is strongly bonded to the wire and reasonably flexible before heat treatment; therefore, the insulated wires can be wound into coils without cracks or spalling. After Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x heat treatment, the coating is sintered to provide reliable ceramic insulation. A few pieces of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x wire (including one over 750 m long) are insulated for our Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x high-field magnet development program. In this paper, we present the technical details of our insulation process, including the formulation of the coating slurry, and the coating application method. We also addressed issues with respect to improving coating quality.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Models of electrical activity in excitable cells involve nonlinear interactions between many ionic currents. Changing parameters in these models can produce a variety of activity patterns with sometimes unexpected effects. Further more, introducing new currents will have different effects depending on the initial parameter set. In this study we combined global sampling of parameter space and local analysis of representative parameter sets in a pituitary cell model to understand the effects of adding K (+) conductances, which mediate some effects of hormone action on these cells. Global sampling ensured that the effects of introducing K (+) conductances were captured across a wide variety of contexts of model parameters. For each type of K (+) conductance we determined the types of behavioral transition that it evoked. Some transitions were counterintuitive, and may have been missed without the use of global sampling. In general, the wide range of transitions that occurred when the same current was applied to the model cell at different locations in parameter space highlight the challenge of making accurate model predictions in light of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Finally, we used bifurcation analysis and fast/slow analysis to investigate why specific transitions occur in representative individual models. This approach relies on the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to quickly map parameter space to model behavior and identify parameter sets for further analysis. Acceleration with modern low-cost GPUs is particularly well suited to exploring the moderate-sized (5-20) parameter spaces of excitable cell and signaling models.",

However, few studies have examined whether Internet news consumption is positively associated with such attitudes. The void is significant given the public's increasing use of online news sources. This study addresses this research gap. We draw on data from four national surveys conducted between 2007 and 2013, which collectively include interviews with more than 13,000 Americans. Using OLS and logistic regression, we assess the relationships between exposure to traditional and online media and perceptions of victimization risk, support for punitive crime policies, and views about police powers. Consistent with prior work, we find positive relationships between exposure to traditional forms of media-television news and crime programming-and anxiety about victimization and support for harsh crime policies. In contrast, Internet news exposure is generally not associated with anxieties about crime or support for getting tough on criminals. However, there is evidence of an interactive relationship between political ideology and Internet news exposure. The results provide little support for cultivation theory in the context of Internet news consumption. We discuss the import of our findings, and suggest new lines of research to explore the correlates and the effects of exposure to online news sources.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In a recent paper, Kristin Mickelson argues that Alfred Mele's Zygote Argument, a popular argument for the claim that the truth of determinism would preclude free action or moral responsibility, is not valid. This sort of objection is meant to generalize to various manipulation arguments. According to Mickelson, the only way to make such arguments valid is to supplement them with an argument that is an inference to the best explanation. In this paper, I argue that there are two other ways in which the proponent of such manipulation arguments can modify their argument, neither of which requires an inference to the best explanation. I then briefly consider and respond to a worry with one of these proposed solutions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is moderately heritable, however genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for MDD, as well as for related continuous outcomes, have not shown consistent results. Attempts to elucidate the genetic basis of MDD may be hindered by heterogeneity in diagnosis. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale provides a widely used tool for measuring depressive symptoms clustered in four different domains which can be combined together into a total score but also can be analysed as separate symptom domains. Method. We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of the CES-D symptom clusters. We recruited 12 cohorts with the 20-or 10-item CES-D scale (32 528 persons). Results. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs713224, located near the brain-expressed melatonin receptor (MTNR1A) gene, was associated with the somatic complaints domain of depression symptoms, with borderline genome-wide significance (p(discovery) = 3.82 x 10(-8)). The SNP was analysed in an additional five cohorts comprising the replication sample (6813 persons). However, the association was not consistent among the replication sample (p(discovery+replication) = 1.10 x 10(-6)) with evidence of heterogeneity. Conclusions. Despite the effort to harmonize the phenotypes across cohorts and participants, our study is still underpowered to detect consistent association for depression, even by means of symptom classification. On the contrary, the SNP-based heritability and co-heritability estimation results suggest that a very minor part of the variation could be captured by GWAS, explaining the reason of sparse findings.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A robust fabrication technology is critical to achieve the high performance in YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) coils as the critical current of the brittle YBCO layer is subject to the strain-induced degradation during coil fabrication. The expected current-carrying capability of the magnet and its temperature dependence are two key inputs to the coil technology development. However, the expected magnet performance is not straightforward to determine because the short-sample critical current depends on both the amplitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field with respect to the broad surface of the tape-form conductor. In this paper, we present an approach to calculate the self-field performance limit for YBCO racetrack coils at 77 and 4.2 K. Critical current of short YBCO samples was measured as a function of the applied field perpendicular to the conductor surface from 0 to 15 T. This field direction limited the conductor critical current. Two double-layer racetrack coils, one with three turns and the other with 10 turns, were wound and tested at 77 and 4.2 K. The test coils reached at least 80% of the expected critical current. The ratio between the coil critical currents at 77 and 4.2 K agreed well with the calculation. We conclude that the presented approach can determine the performance limit in YBCO racetrack coils based on the short-sample critical current and provide a useful guideline for assessing the coil performance and fabrication technology. The correlation of the coil critical current between 77 K and 4.2 K was also observed, allowing the 77 K test to be a cost-effective tool for the development of coil technology.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Community currency systems are said to influence the revival of communities by promoting either local economic growth or social capital accumulation. However, no empirical studies have examined the multiple competing mechanisms for providing social support through transactional networks among participants. The current study connects network structural concepts to theories of social capital, transaction costs, homophily, and resource dependency at multiple levels and evaluates transactional relationships for community rebuilding and local economic development. We examine the evolutionary process of dynamic networks among local residents or organization members with network configurations in one of the largest Japanese community currency systems, \"Peanuts.\" Using longitudinal network data over 12 years for approximately 1400 actors, we conclude that the evolution and achievement of transactional network dynamics and partner selections differ between the two groups of participants: individual members and organization members. We also provide practical implications for sustaining participants' transactions and commitment.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We measured Cu isotope compositions of 12 out of the 14 known IVB iron meteorites. Our results show that IVB iron meteorites display a very large range of delta Cu-65 values (-5.84% < delta Cu-65 < -0.24 parts per thousand; defined as per mil deviation of the Cu-65/Cu-63 ratio from the NIST-976 standard). These Cu isotopic data display clear correlations with W, Pt, and Os isotope ratios, which are very sensitive to secondary neutron capture due to galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation. This demonstrates that delta Cu-65 in IVB irons is majorly modified by neutron capture by the reaction Ni-62(n,gamma) Ni-63 followed by beta decay to 63 Cu. Using correlations with Pt and Os neutron dosimeters, we calculated a pre-exposure delta Cu-65 of -0.3 +/- 0.8% (95% conf.) of IVB irons that agrees well with the Cu isotopic compositions of other iron meteorite groups and falls within the range of chondrites. This shows that the volatile depletion of the IVB parent body is not due to evaporation that should have enriched IVB irons in the heavy Cu isotopes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Reputational sanctions and stigmatization costs share many things in common. In particular, wage reductions in the labor market caused by stigmatization (Rasmusen, 1996), and profit reductions in commercial markets caused by reputational losses due to a firm's previous wrong-doings (Iacobucci, 2014) share many similarities. In this article, I construct a model in which Rasmusen (1996) and Iacobucci (2014) emerge as special cases. I use this model to show that increasing the legal sanction (or the probability of detection) cannot cause a reduction in reputational losses that off-sets the increase in expected total sanction. This clarifies ambiguities in the previous literature, and implies that, absent further considerations, deterrence is enhanced by an increase in legal sanctions and/or the probability of detection. Thus, standard Beckerian dynamics are preserved even when reputational sanctions interact with formal sanctions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Very little research, however, has examined the association between psychopathy and the risk of personal victimization. The current study address this gap in the literature by examining the association between scores on the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy scale and a self-reported measure of victimization by using cross-sectional data drawn from a sample of youth residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (N = 311). The results revealed a positive and statistically significant association between LSPR scores and the odds of being victimized. Additional analyses revealed that two mediators-arrest history and exposure to delinquent peers-were related to personal victimization, but neither of these measures mediated the effects of LSPR scores on victimization. Whether these findings would generalize to other nations remains an issue awaiting future research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper examines whether analysts' pre-tax income forecasts mitigate the tax expense anomaly documented by Thomas and Zhang (J Account Res 49:791-821, 2011). They find that seasonal changes in quarterly income tax expense are positively related to future returns after controlling for the earnings surprise and conclude that investors underreact to value-relevant information in tax expense. When analysts issue both earnings and pre-tax income forecasts, they implicitly provide a forecast of income tax expense. We posit that this implicit forecast helps investors recognize the persistence of current tax expense surprise for future earnings. Accordingly, we expect that mispricing of tax expense will be less severe for firms with earnings and pre-tax income forecasts. As expected, we find that the presence of pre-tax income forecasts significantly weakens the positive relation between tax expense surprise and future returns, consistent with analysts' implicit forecasts of tax expense mitigating the tax expense anomaly.",

      "Abstract Note" : "There is little knowledge about how emotion regulation difficulties interplay with psychopathology in terms of smoking cessation. Participants (n = 250; 53.2 % female, M (age) = 39.5, SD = 13.85) were community-recruited daily smokers (a parts per thousand yen8 cigarettes per day) who self-reported motivation to quit smoking; 38.8 % of the sample met criteria for a current (past 12-month) psychological disorder. Emotion regulation deficits were assessed pre-quit using the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer in J Psychopathol Behav Assess 26(1):41-54, 2004) and smoking behavior in the 28 days post-quit was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell in Measuring alcohol consumption: psychosocial and biochemical methods. Humana Press, Totowa, 1992). A Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis was used to model the effects of past-year psychopathology, DERS (total score), and their interaction, in terms of time to lapse post-quit day. After adjusting for the effects of gender, age, pre-quit level of nicotine dependence, and treatment condition, the model revealed a non-significant effect of past-year psychopathology (OR = 1.14, CI (95 %) = 0.82-1.61) and difficulties with emotion regulation (OR = 1.01, CI (95 %) = 1.00-1.01) on likelihood of lapse rate. However, the interactive effect of psychopathology status and difficulties with emotion regulation was significant (OR = 0.98, CI (95 %) = 0.97-0.99). Specifically, there was a significant conditional effect of psychopathology status on lapse rate likelihood at low, but not high, levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Plots of the cumulative survival functions indicated that for smokers without a past-year psychological disorder, those with lower DERS scores relative to elevated DERS scores had significantly lower likelihood of early smoking lapse, whereas for smokers with past-year psychopathology, DERS scores did not differentially impact lapse rate likelihood. Smokers with emotion regulation difficulties may have challenges quitting, and not having such difficulties, especially without psychopathology, decreases the potential likelihood of early lapse.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Research question: Charities have begun utilizing sport events as a vehicle for obtaining contributions toward a designated cause and to differentiate themselves in the charity market. Although scholarship has focused on how people attach to a charitable organization, there is a lack of research investigating religiously based international charities. Therefore, this paper examines the attachment of participants in a running event fundraiser for a North American based Christian water charity implementing clean water systems in the developing world. Research methods: Part of a larger ethnography, this study focuses upon semi-structured interviews conducted with charity fundraisers, race participants and charity organizers, before, during, and after the Miami Marathon. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded both individually and communally by the authors. Results and Findings: Three distinct themes emerged: (1) embodied philanthropy; (2) embodied internalization of the cause; and (3) religiosity and international philanthropy. Theme three was divided into two sub-themes concerning (3a) religious systems of consumer ethics and global citizenship and (3b) participants as conduits for their religion. These themes developed as distinct responses for how individuals connect to an international cause unrelated to their everyday lives and show how a Christian water charity connects water poverty with the values of current and potential fundraisers. Implications: Findings of this study show the important role of embodied action and religiosity in philanthropy. Results contribute to the existing literature on psychological attachment within the sport management literature, while extending the field to include religiously based international charities.",

We compared two single pancake coils wound by two different HTS wires. One pancake coil is made of a normal HTS wire with an electroplated copper stabilizer. The other pancake coil is made of the same HTS wire with the only difference in an additional outermost layer made of stainless steel. We employed an equivalent circuit model to evaluate our experimental results. We tested both coils by the same simple operating procedure consisting of two steps: first, ramping up of current from zero to holding current (I-H) and second, keeping the I-H at minimum 500 s. We also tested the stability of the coil wound by an HTS wire with an additional layer of stainless steel by applying a current exceeding a critical current of the coil. We observed a charging time of themetal-cladding HTS coil reduced to a quarter of copper-electroplated HTS coil.",

With the multiwidth no-insulation technique incorporated, DP coils were wound with REBCO tapes of five different widths, i.e., 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, and 8.1 mm; DP coils placed at and near the magnet midplane were wound with the narrowest (4.1 mm wide) REBCO tapes, whereas those with progressively wider tapes were placed toward the top and bottom of the magnet, where the \"perpendicular field B-perpendicular to\" is at its peak within the magnet. The magnet was designed to be operated under a conduction cooling environment at 20 K. Once successfully completed, the magnet will be installed as an NMR user facility in the Korea Basic Science Institute. Basic magnet performances and major technical challenges were discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The exponential growth of computing power on leadership scale computing platforms imposes grand challenge to scientific applications' input/output (I/O) performance. To bridge the performance gap between computation and I/O, various parallel I/O libraries have been developed and adopted by computer scientists. These libraries enhance the I/O parallelism by allowing multiple processes to concurrently access the shared data set. Meanwhile, they are integrated with a set of I/O optimization strategies such as data sieving and two-phase I/O to better exploit the supplied bandwidth of the underlying parallel file system. Most of these techniques are optimized for the access on a single bundle of variables generated by the scientific applications during the I/O phase, which is stored in the form of file. Few of these techniques focus on cross-bundle I/O optimizations. In this article, we investigate the potential benefit from cross-bundle I/O aggregation. Based on the analysis of the I/O patterns of a mission-critical scientific application named the Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS-5), we propose a Bundle-based PARallel Aggregation (BPAR) framework with three partitioning schemes to improve its I/O performance as well as the I/O performance of a broad range of other scientific applications. Our experiment result reveals that BPAR can deliver 2.1x I/O performance improvement over the baseline GEOS-5, and it is very promising in accelerating scientific applications' I/O performance on various computing platforms.",

The current research explores the potential of using consumer reminders to curb these effects. This research identifies consumer responsibility reminders as an important factor that can limit indulgent consumption induced by exposure to cute products. Two studies show that the effect of cute products on indulgence can be reduced by (1) reminding consumers of their responsibility for their outcomes in life by enhancing feelings of personal control and (2) reminding consumers of their responsibility to other people by increasing prosocial orientation. Findings from this research have important implications for helping consumers make choices more consistent with their long-term well-being when faced with cute products in various categories.",

Furthermore, the politically skilled overqualified employees' capitalization on opportunities to undertake career development opportunities will results in positive outcomes for both the employees (i.e., increased job satisfaction and reputation) and the organization (i.e., increased organizational commitment).

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents a high-resolution magnetic field mapping system in development that is capable of collecting spatial magnetic field data for NMR magnets. An NMR probe was designed and built with a resonant frequency of 5.73 MHz. The measured Q-factor of the NMR probe is similar to 191 with a half-power bandwidth in the range of 5.72-5.75MHz. An RF continuous-wave technique with magnetic field modulation was utilized to detect the power dispersion of water molecules. The zero-crossing frequency of the NMR dispersion signal corresponds to the magnetic field at the center of the water sample. An embedded system was developed to sweep the frequency and record the reflected RF power simultaneously. A numerically controlled digital oscillator is able to provide a precise frequency step as small as 0.02 Hz, which is equivalent to 4.7 e-7 mT for hydrogen atoms. An RF preamplifier was built to supply up to 4 W of RF power to a bidirectional coupler. The coupler supplies RF power to the NMR probe and channels reflect the RF power back to the detection circuit, which detects the reflected RF power from the NMR probe during the frequency sweep. The homogeneity of an NMR magnet can be determined by magnetic field data.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A three-dimensional finite-element method computational model has been developed for the terminations of a gaseous-helium-cooled superconducting power cable. The model combines turbulent flow physics coupled with heat transfer in fluids and solids and Joule heating. The model can be used to map the termination to identify the locations with the largest temperature gradients, and the design can be optimized to minimize those gradients in an iterative way through multiple simulations. The model also allows for a drastic reduction in time for new design iterations of the physical termination with optimal thermal and fluid characteristics. This paper presents the details of the modeling methodology, and the results are compared with experimental data to show how modern computing power can solve complicated and highly detailed multiphysics simulations to reduce engineering design time.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Innovation networks are vital in advancing new product and service development. Particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, partnering within innovation networks allows to enlarge innovation capabilities and to reach new markets. In order to create effective innovation networks, however, firms are required to adapt to the network. To do so, they must overcome three principal challenges: they need to build partnerships, integrate the partners' value contributions, and coordinate innovation processes. We followed three innovation networks over a three-year period and examined how they successfully used information systems (IS) to respond to these challenges. On the basis of their experiences we identify IS categories and measures that support setting up an information management for networked innovation. We explicate relevant tasks for managing the aspects of \"who, what and how\" in networked innovation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Conductors in pulsed magnets in the U.S. National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab) are rectangular cross section wires of relatively large thickness. During the manufacture of the magnets, some of these conductors are wound to small-diameter coils (less than 15 mm). Because of the large thickness and the small bending radii for winding, the wires undergo large bending strain, sometimes causing breakage. We studied the bending behavior of high-strength conductor wires. In most materials, maximum bending strain can usually be calculated from elongation values obtained in tensile tests. In this paper, however, the maximum bending strain exceeded the elongation of most of our high-strength wires; therefore, we could not estimate bending strain from elongation. The large bending strain that occurs during the manufacture of coils in pulsed magnets causes an increase in residual strain and a decrease in packing factor. Due to the anticlastic effect, the cross section of the wire changes from rectangular to keystone-shaped, with the keystone angle up to 10 degrees. This introduces gaps into the coils, thus reducing the magnetic field by an amount that must be taken into an account. In both tensile-and compressive-strained regions, we observed significant microstructure changes. Certain properties, such as tensile mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, depend directly on microstructure. This paper summarizes our work on both geometry and microstructure evolution in conductors exposed to different bending strain values.",

This paper pursues two objectives in the solenoid design: a constant Fabry factor of 0.16 and a minimum hot-spot temperature in the coil. In order to minimize the hot-spot temperature, cooling discs made of high thermal conductivity materials are inserted to transport heat to disc surfaces fixed at constant temperature (heat sink). Subsequently, two cooling disc configurations are investigated in this paper: discs with heat sinks on the outer surface and on both the inner and outer surfaces. A mathematical model for each configuration is presented and numerically verified using a commercial FEA software. These models are then used to examine the hot-spot temperature variation with respect to the number of cooling discs. In addition, optimal solenoid radius and length, as well as cooling disc volume, are determined for a range of fixed solenoid volumes; thereby, the ideal solenoid volume resulting in the minimum hot-spot temperature is found. In summary, the qualitative trend of the tradeoff between heat transfer and electromagnetic performances are analyzed, and the optimal design is deduced for the maximum performance from a combined standpoint.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has been proposed as an important transdiagnostic variable within various anxiety-related disorders. Research has suggested that individuals high in IU may interpret ambiguous information in a more threatening manner, suggesting a negative interpretation bias for uncertain information. However, interpretation biases within IU have not been adequately tested in the literature. Methods: The current study evaluated negative interpretation biases for uncertain information by directly measuring an individual's interpretations of ambiguous information across two samples. Participants consisted of 76 (Study 1; 72.4% female) and 31 (Study 2; 81% female) undergraduate students. Results: Results indicated that individuals high in IU interpret ambiguous scenarios as more threatening compared to negative and/or positive scenarios (beta = .45, p = .02). In addition, individuals high in IU showed a negative interpretation bias for ambiguous information, but not benign information (Study 1: beta = -.40, p < .001; Study 2: beta = -.57, p = .002). Limitations: Future research should attempt to replicate these findings within clinical populations. In addition, future work would benefit from the inclusion of behavioral assessments of IU. Conclusions: These findings are the first to detect the presence of a negative interpretation bias for uncertain information among individuals high in IU utilizing a task designed to directly measure an individual's interpretation of information. Given the efficacy and low economic burden associated with interpretation bias modification protocols, and the transdiagnostic nature of IU, targeting IU within these protocols could have a tremendous public health impact.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background and objectives: Smoking-specific experiential avoidance is related to the maintenance of cigarette smoking. However, it is unclear whether sustained smoking abstinence is associated with subsequent reductions in smoking-specific experiential avoidance. Methods: Daily smokers (n = 149) underwent a cessation attempt in the context of a 4-session smoking cessation treatment trial. Participants provided biochemical verification of smoking status at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 Month post-quit day. Smoking-specific experiential avoidance was assessed per the Avoidance and Inflexibility Scale (AIS) - the total score and two factor scores were examined at 1 Month post-quit day as a function of abstinence status. Two path models were conducted and included participant sex, treatment condition, and pre-cessation nicotine dependence, smoking-specific experiential avoidance, and presence of emotional disorders as covariates. Results: After adjusting for covariates, sustained smoking abstinence was associated with a reduction in the AIS total score at Month 1 post-quit (beta = -.45, p < .001). Sustained smoking abstinence was associated with reductions across both facets of experiential avoidance - smoking-related thoughts and feelings (beta = -.44, p < .001) and internal bodily sensations (beta=-.41, p < .001). Limitations: Biochemical verification of smoking status was confirmed only at three time points post-quit day, and continued abstinence throughout the one-month post-quitting period is not fully known. Conclusions: Sustained smoking abstinence may contribute to reductions in smoking-specific experiential avoidance. Findings add to the research documenting the relevance of experiential avoidance in various processes of smoking (including smoking abstinence). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

X-ray diffraction confirmed the beta-phase and scanning electron microscopy showed plate-like morphology of the sample. For T > 3 K, the data of magnetic susceptibility chi vs. T fit the Curie-Weiss (CW) law yielding 0 = -2.5 K,mu = 2.16 mu(B) per Co2+ and g=2.49 for spin S=1/2 of the low spin-state of Co2+ However for T < 3 K, they vs. T data deviates from the CW law yielding a peak in chi at T-max = 1.9 K.

The data of magnetization M vs. H at T=1 K agrees with the predictions of the BF model with J/k(B) = 1.5 K, yielding saturation magnetization M-s =12.16 emu/g above 60 kOe corresponding to complete alignment of the spins.

We find that Fe nanostripes exhibit large in plane uniaxial anisotropy and nearly square hysteresis loops with energy products (BHmax) exceeding 3 MGOe at room temperature. High density Fe nanostripes were fabricated on 70 nm flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) gratings, which were made by a roll-to-roll (R2R) UV nanoimprint lithography technique. We observed large in-plane uniaxial anisotropies along the long dimension of nanostripes that can be attributed to the shape.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents a passive shimming design approach for a magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR magnet. In order to achieve a 1.5-T magic-angle field in NMR samples, we created two independent orthogonal magnetic vector fields by two separate coils: the dipole and the solenoid. These two coils create a combined 1.5-T magnetic field vector directed at the magic angle (54.74 degrees from the spinning axis). Additionally, the stringent magnetic field homogeneity requirement of the MAS magnet is the same as that of a solenoidal NMR magnet. The challenge for the magic-angle passive shimming design is to correct both the dipole and solenoid magnetic field spherical harmonics with one set of iron pieces, the so-called ferromagnetic shimming. Furthermore, the magnetization of the iron pieces is produced by both the dipole and solenoid coils. In our design approach, a matrix of 2 mm x 5 mm iron pieces with different thicknesses was attached to a thin-walled tube, of 90-mm diameter and 40 mm high. Two sets of spherical harmonic coefficients were calculated for both the dipole and solenoid coil windings. By using the multiple-objective linear programming optimization technique and coordinate transformations, we have designed a passive shimming set that can theoretically reduce 22 lower order spherical harmonics and improve the homogeneity of our MAS NMR magnet.",

We derive simple relationships between the three generating functions, and show that all three generating functions are joint solutions of a common 12th order Fuchsian linear ODE. We find that the 8th order differential operators can each be rewritten as a direct sum of a direct product, with operators no larger than 3rd order. We give closed-form expressions for all the solutions of these operators in terms of F-2(1) hypergeometric functions with rational and algebraic arguments. The solutions of these linear differential operators can in fact be expressed in terms of two modular forms, since these F-2(1) hypergeometric functions can be expressed with two, rational or algebraic, pullbacks.",

To develop a short form of the MEQ to use when time is limited, participants from two samples (N = 719; N = 352) retrieved autobiographical memories, rated the phenomenological experience of each memory and completed several scales measuring psychological distress. For each MEQ dimension, the number of items was reduced by one-half based on item content and item-total correlations. Each short-form scale had acceptable internal consistency (median alpha = .79), and, similar to the long-form version of the scales, the new short scales correlated with psychological distress in theoretically meaningful ways. The new short form of the MEQ has similar psychometric proprieties as the original long form and can be used when time is limited.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Biohydrogen production has been demonstrated only at the laboratory scale, and the yield of H-2 from any of the tested processes is still low for commercial application. Therefore, much scientific research is needed to address the issue of increasing biohydrogen production rate. For that, in this work, through a brief review of the literature and laboratory data, several genetic modification targets for microalgae hydrogen production enhancement are identified. As a result, a mathematical correlation, with dependence on the process variables, is proposed to calculate the resulting effect on H-2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The proposed correlation gives an initial assessment on how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other, therefore providing possible means for a consistent strategy for sustainable biohydrogen supply. A simplified mathematical model is proposed for a well stirred photobioreactor based on the species conservation principle. Microalgae growth was simulated for 15 days, showing how a set of microalgae genetic modifications affects H-2 production either in combination or individually. For that, a chloroplast targeted total genetic modification parameter was defined, xi(T). The H-2 mass production efficiency, n, increasing rate is high up to xi(T) approximate to 4, showing a trend to stabilization thereafter at eta = 10 %, thus there is a value for eT, beyond which it is not worth it to increase, since the H-2 production is limited by the amount of biomass present in the medium, xi(T) approximate to 10 in the case of this study. Therefore, the model is expected to be an important and simple tool for design, control and optimization of microalgae derived hydrogen processes. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

      "Abstract Note" : "Aerosol deposition is an important pathway for delivering trace elements, including those of anthropogenic origin, into the Arctic. Assessment of this process is difficult in the harsh Arctic environment, and limited field studies have forced a reliance on poorly constrained models. Here we use the cosmic ray produced radioisotope, Be-7, to trace the atmospheric deposition of elements within the Arctic water/ice/snow system, and link aerosol concentrations to flux. Seawater, ice, snow, melt pond, and aerosol samples were collected during late summer 2011 as part of the RV Polarstern's ARK-XXVI/3 campaign. From the measured 7Be inventories we determined an average Be-7 flux of 109 dpm/m(2)/d, which is consistent with results from previous studies in the region. Snow, ice and melt ponds represent significant reservoirs of 7Be, and the relative Be-7 inventory in ice increased through late August, as melt pond inventories decreased with onset of freezing. The total (water/ice/snow system) inventory was relatively constant across our transect, but mixed layer inventories increased towards lower latitudes as ice-free, open water was approached. The latter gradient drives transport of 7Be, and presumably other atmospherically-derived species, towards the ice-covered ocean mixed layer. This is modeled by advective transport along the Transpolar Drift. The average Be-7 aerosol concentration was 0.0182 dpm/m(3). None of the lithogenic aerosol elements showed any significant enrichment above crustal composition, while the pollution-derived elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sb, Pb) showed varying degrees of enrichment relative to crustal values. Historical aerosol Be-7 data was used to derive a seasonal cycle in the Be-7 inventory that was calibrated to the inventory measured in this study, using an effective bulk (wet plus dry) deposition velocity of 1350 m/day. This deposition velocity was then used to estimate the seasonal atmospheric flux of aerosol trace elements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) as in vitro multicellular aggregates has been increasingly used as a method to model early embryonic development. Three-dimensional assemblies of hPSCs facilitate interactions between cells and their microenvironment to promote morphogenesis, analogous to the multicellular organization that accompanies embryogenesis. In this paper, we describe a method for reproducibly generating and maintaining populations of homogeneous three-dimensional hPSC aggregates using forced aggregation and rotary orbital suspension culture. We propose solutions to several challenges associated with the consistent formation and extended culture of cell spheroids generated from hPSCs and their differentiated progeny. Further, we provide examples to demonstrate how aggregation can be used as a tool to select specific subpopulations of cells to create homotypic spheroids, or as a means to introduce multiple cell types to create heterotypic tissue constructs. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggregation and rotary suspension method can be used to support culture and maintenance of hPSC-derived cell populations representing each of the three germ layers, underscoring the utility of this platform for culturing many different cell types.

      "Abstract Note" : "Seasonal (spring freshet, summer-autumn, and winter) variability in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the Yukon River was determined using advanced one-and two-dimensional (2D) solid-state NMR spectroscopy, coupled with isotopic measurements and UV-visible spectroscopy. Analyses were performed on two major DOM fractions, the hydrophobic organic acid (HPOA) and transphilic organic acid (TPIA) fractions obtained using XAD resins. Together these two fractions comprised 64-74% of the total DOM. Carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM) accounted for the majority of carbon atoms in the HPOA (63-77%) and TPIA (54-78%) samples, and more so in winter and summer than in spring samples. 2D and selective NMR data revealed association of abundant nonprotonated O-alkyl and quaternary alkyl C (OCnp, OCnpO and C-q, 13-17% of HPOA and 15-20% of TPIA) and isolated O-CH structures with CRAM, which were not recognized in previous studies. Spectral editing and 2D NMR allowed for the discrimination of carbohydrate-like O-alkyl C from non-carbohydrate O-alkyl C. Whereas two spring freshet TPIA samples contained carbohydrate clusters such as carboxylated carbohydrates (16% and 26%), TPIA samples from other seasons or HPOA samples mostly had small amounts (<8%) of sugar rings dispersed in a nonpolar alkyl environment. Though nonprotonated aromatic C represented the largest fraction of aromatic C in all HPOA/TPIA isolates, only a small fraction (similar to 5% in HPOA and 3% in TPIA) was possibly associated with dissolved black carbon. Our results imply a relatively stable portion of DOM exported by the Yukon River across different seasons, due to the predominance of CRAM and their associated nonprotonated C-O and O-C-O structures, and elevated reactivity (bio- and photo-lability) of spring DOM due to the presence of terrestrial inputs enriched in carbohydrates and aromatic structures.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this study, we developed a novel near-infrared fluorescence based multiplex lateral flow immunoassay by conjugating a near-infrared label to broad-specificity monoclonal antibody/receptor as detection complexes. Different antigens were dispensed onto separate test zones of nitrocellulose membrane to serve as capture reagents. This assay format allowed the simultaneous detection of four families of antibiotics (beta-lactams, tetracyclines, quinolones and sulfonamides) in milk within 20 min. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of target antibiotics were realized by imaging the fluorescence intensity of the near infrared label captured on respective test lines. For qualitative analysis, the cut-off values of beta-lactams, tetracyclines, quinolones and sulfonamides were determined to be 8 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL respectively, which were much lower than the conventional gold nanoparticle based lateral flow immunoassay. For quantitative analysis, the detection ranges were 0.26-3.56 ng/mL for beta-lactams, 0.04-0.98 ng/mL for tetracyclines, 0.08-2.0 ng/mL for quinolones, and 0.1-3.98 ng/mL for sulfonamides, with linear correlation coefficients higher than 0.97. The mean spiked recoveries ranged from 93.7% to 108.2% with coefficient of variations less than 163%. These results demonstrated that this novel immunoassay is a promising approach for rapidly screening the four families of antibiotic residues in milk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Europium chalcogenides (EuX, X = O, S, Se, Te), a class of prototypical Heisenberg magnetic semiconductors, exhibit intriguing properties in optics, magnetism, and magneto-optics at the nanoscale, and have broad application potential in optical/magnetic sensors, spintronics, optical isolators, etc. EuX nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit enhanced properties, such as high saturation magnetization, a strong magneto-optic effect (Faraday rotation), and high magneto resistance, which are all unanimously dependent on the NC's size, shape, and surface information. In this report, we give an overview of the fundamental properties of bulk EuX, and illustrate the quantum confinement effects on the optical, magnetic and magneto-optical properties of EuX nanostructures. We then focus on doping and self-assembly-two efficient methods that enhance magnetic properties by manipulating magnetic coupling in EuX nanostructures. In particular, we look towards future research on Eu2+ NCs, which along with the overview provides an up-to-date platform for evaluating the fundamental properties and application potential of Eu-based semiconductors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In the aftermath of disasters, evacuating aging victims and maintaining an optimal flow of critical resources in order to serve their needs becomes problematic, especially for Gulf Coast states in the USA such as Florida, where more than 6.9 million (36.9%) of the population are over age 50. Scanning the literature, there is no substantial prior work that has synthesized the requirements for a multi-modal emergency needs assessment that could facilitate the safe and accessible evacuation of aging people, and optimize the flow of resources into the affected region to satisfy the needs of those who remain. This paper presents a review of the aging population-focused emergency literature utilizing a knowledge base development methodology supported with a geographic information system-based case study application set in Florida. Importance is given to both ensuring the resiliency of the transportation infrastructure and meeting the needs of aging populations. As a result of this metadata-based analysis, critical research needs and challenges are presented with planning recommendations and future research directions. Results clearly indicate that transportation agencies should focus on clear and fast dissemination of disaster-related information to the aging populations. The use of paratransit services for evacuating aging people, especially those living independently and/or in rural areas, is also found to be of paramount importance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We summarize recent experiments on thermal counterflow turbulence in superfluid He-4, emphasizing the observation of turbulence in the normal fluid and its effect on the decay process when the heat flux is turned off. We argue that what is observed as turbulence in the normal fluid is a novel form of coupled turbulence in the superfluid and normal components, with injection of energy on the scales of both the (large) channel width and the (small) spacing between quantized vortices. Although an understanding of this coupled turbulence remains challenging, a theory of its decay is developed which accounts for the experimental observations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Uncertainties in parameter values in microbicide pharmacokinetics (PK) models confound the models' use in understanding the determinants of drug delivery and in designing and interpreting dosing and sampling in PK studies. A global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices) was performed for a compartmental model of the pharmacokinetics of gel delivery of tenofovir to the vaginal mucosa. The model's parameter space was explored to quantify model output sensitivities to parameters characterizing properties for the geledrug product (volume, drug transport, initial loading) and host environment (thicknesses of the mucosal epithelium and stroma and the role of ambient vaginal fluid in diluting gel). Greatest sensitivities overall were to the initial drug concentration in gel, gel-epithelium partition coefficient for drug, and rate constant for gel dilution by vaginal fluid. Sensitivities for 3 PK measures of drug concentration values were somewhat different than those for the kinetic PK measure. Sensitivities in the stromal compartment (where tenofovir acts against host cells) and a simulated biopsy also depended on thicknesses of epithelium and stroma. This methodology and results here contribute an approach to help interpret uncertainties in measures of vaginal microbicide gel properties and their host environment. In turn, this will inform rational gel design and optimization. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Rates of home injury are particularly high in the homes of caregivers who are referred for intervention services by child welfare agents. However, there are few validated methods of home safety assessment available. The Home Safety and Beautification Assessment (HSBA) was developed to assist intervention planning specific to home safety and appearance in a sample of 77 mothers who were referred to treatment by Child Welfare Services. Exploratory factor analysis of HSBA items indicated that safety and appearance factors emerged across rooms in the home, and internal consistencies were good. For each room, the sums of assessors' safety and appearance intervention priority item scores were correlated with the assessors' global safety and appearance ratings of the entire home, respectively. The participants' overall room attractiveness scores were correlated with the assessors' overall room appearance intervention priority scores, whereas the participants' ratings of overall room safety were not correlated with the assessors' overall room safety intervention priority scores. Participants' scores on the Abuse subscale of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, personal income, and education level were not associated with the assessors' home safety and appearance intervention priority ratings, suggesting the HSBA is assessing constructs that are distinct from child abuse potential and socioeconomic status. The results support the HSBA in a sample referred to treatment by child welfare agents.",

      "Abstract Note" : "With the development of modern agriculture, large amount of fertilizer and pesticide outflow from farming land causes great waste and serious pollution to surface water and groundwater, and threatens ecological environment and even human life. In this paper, laboratory experiments are conducted to simulate adsorbed Cr(VI) transfer from soil into runoff. A two-layer in-mixing analytical model is applied to analyze laboratory experimental results. A data assimilation (DA) method via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used to update parameters and improve modeling results. In comparison with the experimental data, DA updated modeling results are much better than those without the updating. To make predictions better, the inflation method with a constant inflation factor via DA method was used to compensate the fast decrease of ensemble spread partially related to filter inbreeding. Based on the used rainfall and relevant physical principles, the updated value of the incomplete mixing coefficient gamma is about 14.0 times of the value of the incomplete mixing coefficient alpha in experiment 1 and about 7.4 times in experiment 2, while the difference between the flow rate of runoff and infiltration is not so large even after reaching stable infiltration condition. The results indicate the loss of Cr(VI) in soil solute is mainly due to infiltration, rather than surface runoff. With the increase of mixing layer depth, soil adsorption capacity will increase and the loss of soil solute will decrease. The study results provide information for reducing and even preventing the agricultural nonpoint source pollution.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: The primary purpose of this paper was to narratively review the research testing the effects of mindfulness meditation on stress and anxiety in the college students; reviewing the inclusion of mindfulness was a secondary purpose. Methods: A literature search resulted in 57 studies on the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in reducing stress and anxiety in college students. Conclusions: Researchers examined anxiety in 40 studies, self-reported stress in 34, physiological stress in 11, and mindfulness in 24. Thirty-three of 40 and 25 of 34 studies showed significant decreases in anxiety and stress respectively; 22 of 24 showed an increase in mindfulness. Physiological stress had inconsistent results indicating a need for further research. Overall, mindfulness meditation shows promise in reducing stress and anxiety in college students. Additionally, there are a number of differences in mindfulness interventions including frequency, duration, instructional method, and inclusion of yoga, that need quantitative examination (meta-analysis) to determine which is most effective.

      "Abstract Note" : "We study majority voting over two alternatives in small groups. Individuals have identical preferences but are uncertain about which alternative can better achieve their common interest. Before voting, each individual can obtain information by buying a valuable but imperfect signal about the better alternative. Voting is either voluntary or compulsory. In the compulsory mode, each individual must vote between the two alternatives, while in the voluntary mode they can also abstain. An uninformed, random vote generates a negative externality since it may override an informative group decision in pivotal events. In our experiments, participants in randomly re-matched groups obtain information more often with compulsory than voluntary voting, and the average number of signals is greater in larger than smaller groups. Surprisingly, uninformed voting is common even in the voluntary model Finally, group performance is poor in all treatments, indicating the need to reconsider current practice of jury and committee voting.

      "Abstract Note" : "Motivated performance (MP) tasks include mental stressors characterized by a high degree of motivation, individual engagement, and sympathetic overstimulation. It is therefore important to document the independent influence of motivation apart from engagement on markers of cardiovascular autonomic modulation, including vasomotor tone (low-frequency systolic blood pressure, LFSBP), blood pressure homeostasis (baroreflex sensitivity, BRS), and myocardial oxygen consumption (rate pressure product, RPP). Accordingly, an arithmetic task (AT) was used to manipulate motivation to evaluate its impact on cardiovascular reactivity. Forty-two young adults (M-age=20.21 years, SD=2.09) qualified for the study. After a 10-min resting period, electrocardiogram and finger beat-to-beat blood pressure were recorded at three distinct 5-min stages: baseline (BASE), AT, and recovery (REC). Prior to AT initiation, participants were randomized into two groups based on directions stating that the AT task was either designed to be entertaining and fun (low MP, LMP) or a test diagnostic of one's intelligence (high MP, HMP). Independent of task engagement ratings, motivation to complete the AT task as well as solution success was significantly greater in the HMP than the LMP condition. Regarding physiological parameters, two (LMP vs. HMP) x three (BASE, AT, REC) repeated measures ANOVAs revealed no significant baseline differences but a significant higher order interaction indicating that in comparison to LMP, individuals in the HMP condition had significantly higher vasomotor tone and myocardial oxygen consumption but not BRS. Greater motivation during a performance task may provide the substrate for the development of adverse cardiovascular events by increasing sympathetic activity and ultimately increasing myocardial oxygen demand which could lead to acute coronary syndromes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: It has been documented in laboratory settings that familiarizing listeners with dysarthric speech improves intelligibility of that speech. If these findings can be replicated in real-world settings, the ability to improve communicative function by focusing on communication partners has major implications for extending clinical practice in dysarthria rehabilitation. An important step toward development of a listener-targeted treatment approach requires establishment of its ecological validity. To this end, the present study leveraged the mechanism of crowdsourcing to determine whether perceptual-training benefits achieved by listeners in the laboratory could be elicited in an at-home computer-based scenario. Method: Perceptual-training data (i.e., intelligibility scores from a posttraining transcription task) were collected from listeners in 2 settings-the laboratory and the crowdsourcing website Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results: Consistent with previous findings, results revealed a main effect of training condition (training vs. control) on intelligibility scores. There was, however, no effect of training setting (Mechanical Turk vs. laboratory). Thus, the perceptual benefit achieved via Mechanical Turk was comparable to that achieved in the laboratory. Conclusion: This study provides evidence regarding the ecological validity of perceptual-training paradigms designed to improve intelligibility of dysarthric speech, thereby supporting their continued advancement as a listener-targeted treatment option.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Phenomenology is a critical component of autobiographical memory retrieval; it reflects both (a) memory-specific features and (b) stable individual differences. Few studies have tested phenomenology longitudinally. The present work examined the continuity of memory phenomenology in a sample of Italians adults (N = 105) over a 4-week period. Participants retrieved two 'key' personal memories, a Turning Point and an Early Childhood Memory, rated the phenomenology of each memory, and completed measures of personality, psychological distress and subjective well-being. Phenomenological ratings were moderately stable over time (median correlation >.40), regardless of memory content. Personality traits, psychological distress and well-being were associated with phenomenology cross-sectionally and with changes in phenomenology over time. These results suggest that how individuals re-experience their most important personal memories is relatively consistent over time and shaped by both trait and state aspects of psychological functioning.

We theorized that free will extends beyond morality to serve as the basis for accountability and the capacity for change more broadly, not only for others but also for the self. Five experiments showed that people attributed higher freedom of will to negative than to positive valence, regardless of morality or intent, for both self and others. In recalling everyday life situations and in classical decision making paradigms, negative actions, negatives outcomes, and negative framing were attributed higher free will than positive ones. Free will attributions were mainly driven by action or outcome valence, but not intent. These findings show consistent support for the idea that free will underlies laypersons' sense-making for accountability and change under negative circumstances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "In the socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), the development of a social bonding is indicated by the formation of partner preference, which involves a variety of environmental and neurochemical factors and brain structures. In a most recent study in female prairie voles, we found that treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) facilitates the formation of partner preference through up-regulation of oxytocin receptor (OTR) and vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) genes expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that TSA treatment also facilitates partner preference formation and alters OTR and V1aR genes expression in the NAcc in male prairie voles. We thus observed that central injection of TSA dose-dependently promoted the formation of partner preference in the absence of mating in male prairie voles. Interestingly, TSA treatment up-regulated OTR, but not V1aR, gene expression in the NAcc similarly as they were affected by mating - an essential process for naturally occurring partner preference. These data, together with others, not only indicate the involvement of epigenetic events but also the potential role of NAcc oxytocin in the regulation of partner preference in both male and female prairie voles.

      "Abstract Note" : "A limited number of studies have been conducted that identify the major drivers of restaurant financial performance. In addition, how an excellence certificate moderates the relationship between determinants and restaurant financial performance is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of social media reviews and operating efficiency metrics on restaurant financial performance and to explore the moderating role of an excellence certificate. The findings of this study reveal that the number of online reviews customers make has a significant positive impact on restaurant performance. Additionally, customer overall rating, guest served per labor hour, and the food quality offered by the restaurant influence restaurant performance. The moderating effect of the restaurant excellence certificate between the number of reviews and restaurant performance are found to be significant. For a restaurant with an excellence certificate, a larger number of reviews or a better overall rating promotes net sales, guest counts, and average check to a larger degree compared to a restaurant without an excellence certificate. Consequently, in order to enhance a restaurant's top line, restaurant operators with an excellence certificate should keep the number of customer comments high and positive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "This article offers a new perspective on customer-company identification (CCI) by focusing on CCI's underlying self-motives: self-uncertainty and self-enhancement. More precisely, an operationalization is proposed in which cognitive (CCICog) and affective (CCIAff) dimensions of CCI are driven by different self-motives: CCICog by self-uncertainty and CCIAff by self-enhancement. Focusing on these self-motives reveals that CCICog and CCIAff affect some customer attitudes and behaviors in opposite ways but affect other attitudes and behaviors similarly. A cross-sectional survey that examines outcomes of CCICog and CCIAff supports the proposed conceptualization of CCI and suggests the dimensions differ in how each impacts customer-company relationships. Furthermore, the study suggests that combining the dimensions together in higher order constructs or examining only one dimension can lead to misleading conclusions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The level of lead (Pb) exposure in children has decreased dramatically since restrictions on its use were implemented. However, even with restrictions, children are exposed to Pb and still present with cognitive and behavioral deficits. One prominent aspect of the exposome of these children is that many come from low social economic status (SES) conditions, and low SES is associated with stress. In order to compare the combined effects of early stress and Pb, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to vehicle or Pb either alone or in combination with maternal separation stress during brain development (i.e., postnatal day (P)4P-11, P19, or P28). Maternally separated/isolated pups had lower body and thymus weights during exposure and had increased levels of blood Pb compared with vehicle controls. Isolation, but not Pb, affected the response to an acute stressor (standing in shallow water) when assessed on P19 and P29, but not earlier on P11. Interactions of Pb and isolation were found on monoamines in the neostriatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus on turnover but not on levels, and most changes were on dopamine turnover. Isolation had greater short-term effects than Pb. Interactions were dependent on age, sex, and acute stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In their original article, Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Romer (1993) reviewed the evidence concerning the conditions of optimal learning and found that individualized practice with training tasks (selected by a supervising teacher) with a clear performance goal and immediate informative feedback was associated with marked improvement. We found that this type of deliberate practice was prevalent when advanced musicians practice alone and found its accumulated duration related to attained music performance. In contrast, Macnamara, Moreau, and Hambrick's (2016, this issue) main meta-analysis examines the use of the term deliberate practice to refer to a much broader and less defined concept including virtually any type of sport-specific activity, such as group activities, watching games on television, and even play and competitions. Summing up every hour of any type of practice during an individual's career implies that the impact of all types of practice activity on performance is equalan assumption that I show is inconsistent with the evidence. Future research should collect objective measures of representative performance with a longitudinal description of all the changes in different aspects of the performance so that any proximal conditions of deliberate practice related to effective improvements can be identified and analyzed experimentally.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Previous work documented complete perchlorate reduction in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) using methane as the sole electron donor and carbon source. This work explores how the biofilm's microbial community evolved as the biofilm stage-wise reduced different combinations of perchlorate, nitrate, and nitrite. The initial inoculum, carrying out anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (ANMO-D), was dominated by uncultured Anaerolineaceae and Ferruginibacter sp. The microbial community significantly changed after it was inoculated into the CH4-based MBfR and fed with a medium containing perchlorate and nitrite. Archaea were lost within the first 40 days, and the uncultured Anaerolineaceae and Ferruginibacter sp. also had significant losses. Replacing them were anoxic methanotrophs, especially Methylocystis, which accounted for more than 25 % of total bacteria. Once the methanotrophs became important, methanol-oxidizing denitrifying bacteria, namely, Methloversatilis and Methylophilus, became important in the biofilm, probably by utilizing organic matter generated by the metabolism of methanotrophs. When methane consumption was equal to the maximum-possible electron-donor supply, Methylomonas, also an anoxic methanotroph, accounted for > 10 % of total bacteria and remained a major part of the community until the end of the experiments. We propose that aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification and perchlorate reduction (AMO-D and AMO-PR) directly oxidized methane and reduced NO3- to NO2- or N2O under anoxic condition, producing organic matter for methanol-assimilating denitrification and perchlorate reduction (MA-D and MA-PR) to reduce NO3-. Simultaneously, bacteria capable of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification and perchlorate reduction (ANMO-D and ANMO-PR) used methane as the electron donor to respire NO3- or ClO4- directly.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The resonance-enhanced microjet actuator which was developed at the Advanced Aero-Propulsion Laboratory at Florida State University is a fluidic-based device that produces pulsed, supersonic microjets by utilizing a number of microscale, flow-acoustic resonance phenomena. The micro-actuator used in this study consists of an underexpanded source jet that flows into a cylindrical cavity with a single, 1-mm-diameter exhaust orifice through which an unsteady, supersonic jet issues at a resonant frequency of 7 kHz. The flowfields of a 1-mm underexpanded free jet and the micro-actuator are studied in detail using high-magnification, phase-locked flow visualizations (microschlieren) and two-component particle image velocimetry. These are the first direct measurements of the velocity fields produced by such actuators. Comparisons are made between the flow visualizations and the velocity field measurements. The results clearly show that the microactuator produces pulsed, supersonic jets with velocities exceeding 400 m/s for roughly 60 % of their cycles. With high unsteady momentum output, this type of microactuator has potential in a range of ow control applications.",

      "Abstract Note" : "For flow control applications requiring high-frequency excitation, very few actuators have sufficient dynamic response and/or control authority to be useful in high-speed flows. Due to this reason, experiments involving high-frequency excitation, attempted in the past, have been limited to either low-frequency actuation with reasonable control authority or moderate-frequency actuation with limited control authority. The current work expands on the previous development of the resonance-enhanced microactuators to design actuators that are capable of producing high-amplitude pulses at much higher frequencies [O (10 kHz)]. Using lumped element modeling, two actuators have been designed with nominal frequencies of 20 and 50 kHz. Extensive benchtop characterization using acoustic measurements as well as optical diagnostics using a high-resolution micro-schlieren setup is employed to characterize the dynamic response of these actuators. The actuators performed at a range of frequencies, 20.3-27.8 and 54.8-78.2 kHz, respectively. In addition to providing information on the actuator flow physics and performance at various operating conditions, this study serves to develop easy-to-integrate high-frequency actuators for active control of high-speed jets. Preliminary testing of these actuators is performed by implementing the 20-kHz actuator on a Mach 0.9 free jet flow field for noise reduction. Acoustic measurements in the jet near field demonstrate attenuation of radiated noise at all observation angles.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Flow field characteristics of a moderate aspect ratio supersonic rectangular jet were examined at two overexpanded, a perfectly expanded, and an underexpanded jet conditions. The underexpanded and one overexpanded operating condition were of maximum screech, while the second overexpanded condition was of minimum screech intensity. Streamwise particle image velocimetry was performed along both major and minor axes of the jet and the measurements were made up to 30 nozzle heights, h, where h is the small dimension of the nozzle. Select cross planes were examined using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry to investigate the jet development and the role streamwise vortices play in jet spreading at each operating condition. The results show that streamwise vortices present at the nozzle corners along with vortices excited by screech tones play a major role in the jet evolution. All cases except for the perfectly expanded operating condition exhibited axis switching at streamwise locations ranging from 11 to 16 nozzle heights downstream of the exit. The overexpanded condition of maximum screech showed the most upstream switch over, while the underexpanded case showed the farthest downstream. Both of the maximum screeching cases developed into a diamond cross-sectional profile far downstream of the exit, while the ideally expanded case maintained a rectangular shape. The overexpanded minimum screeching case eventually decayed into an oblong profile.",

However, no studies have demonstrated whether AS prior to a Criterion A traumatic event predicts later PTSS. The present study evaluated whether preshooting AS predicted PTSS following a campus shooting, as well as whether preshooting AS interacted with shooting exposure to predict PTSS. Participants comprised undergraduates (N = 71) who completed a self-report battery upon enrolling in Introductory Psychology. After a campus shooting later in the semester, they were invited to complete measures of PTSS and level of exposure to the shooting. Preshooting levels of AS significantly predicted PTSS after the shooting. This effect was qualified by a significant AS by shooting exposure interaction, such that those with high AS who were exposed to the shooting reported the greatest levels of PTSS. Though all three of the preshooting physical, cognitive, and social AS subfactors demonstrated main effects significantly predicting postshooting PTSS, only AS physical concerns significantly interacted with shooting exposure. The implications of this study concerning AS as a causal risk factor for PTSD are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the belief that anxious arousal is harmful, is a malleable risk factor that has been implicated in anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents. Although there is some evidence that adolescents possess distinct developmental trajectories, few studies have explored this topic. This study examined the developmental trajectory of AS in 248 adolescents (M age = 11.0 years, SD = 0.82; 56% male) across 6 years, beginning when children were age 11. This study also examined the influence of AS trajectories on anxiety and depression at age 16. Finally, this study examined the utility of AS classes in identifying anxiety and depression growth. Three AS classes were found, described by normative-stable, high-stable, and high-unstable trajectories. Adolescents in the high-stable and the high-unstable AS classes had higher levels of anxiety and depression at age 16 than did adolescents in the normative-stable AS class. In addition, the anxiety and depression trajectories fit by AS class mirrored the AS class trajectories. These findings suggest three AS trajectories can be identified in adolescents. These trajectories are discussed in relation to a developmental perspective of AS.",

Findings indicated that exploration, resolution, and affirmation increased over time for both cohorts. Among early adolescents, growth in exploration was associated with more depressive symptoms during middle adolescence, whereas higher initial levels and greater rates of change of affirmation predicted fewer subsequent depressive symptoms. Among middle adolescents, higher baseline levels of exploration and affirmation predicted fewer depressive symptoms in late adolescence. Higher initial levels and greater change in affirmation predicted higher self-esteem among both cohorts. Findings highlight the developmental and multifaceted quality of ethnic identity and that associations between ethnic identity and adjustment may vary by adolescent developmental stage.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The study explored instructional benefits of a storyline gaming characteristic (GC) on learning effectiveness, efficiency, and engagement with the use of an online instructional simulation for graduate students in an introductory statistics course. A storyline is a game-design element that connects scenes with the educational content. In order to examine the interactions between the storyline GC and human performance, a storyline was embedded in a simulation. The goal of the simulation was to engage students in problem-solving and data analysis in the context of basic statistics by using real-world examples. The authors developed two different versions of the simulation: (1) Simulation+No GC, and (2) Simulation+Storyline GC. Both versions shared the same instructional content but differed in the presence or absence of a storyline GC. The results indicated that adding a storyline to a simulation did not result in significant improvements in learning effectiveness, efficiency, or engagement. However, both instructional methods (simulation and simulation with a storyline) showed significant learning gains from pre- to post-test. The findings of this study offer future directions for embedding a storyline GC into learning content.",

They are also important for IgE-facilitated allergen presentation to T cells by antigen-presenting cells. Objective: To investigate whether the proximity of IgE binding sites on an allergen affects immune complex shape and subsequent effector cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We constructed artificial allergens by grafting IgE epitopes in different numbers and proximity onto a scaffold protein. The shape of immune complexes formed between artificial allergens and the corresponding IgE was studied by negative-stain electron microscopy. Allergenic activity was determined using basophil activation assays. Mice were primed with IgE, followed by injection of artificial allergens to evaluate their in vivo allergenic activity. Severity of systemic anaphylaxis was measured by changes in body temperature. Results: We could demonstrate simultaneous binding of 4 IgE antibodies in close vicinity to each other. The proximity of IgE binding sites on allergens influenced the shape of the resulting immune complexes and the magnitude of effector cell activation and in vivo inflammation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the proximity of IgE epitopes on an allergen affects its allergenic activity. We thus identified a novel mechanism by which IgE-allergen complexes regulate allergic inflammation. This mechanism should be important for allergy and other immune complex-mediated diseases.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives/hypothesis. The purpose of this project was to determine the spectral and electroglottograph (EGG) differences exhibited by classically trained female singers when singing through their primo passaggio. The hypotheses were that the singers would exhibit relatively steady EGG levels and minimal changes in speech spectra when singing through their primo passaggio. It also was hypothesized that EGG and spectral measurements at the crest and trough of the vibrato cycles would be similar to each other. Study Design. The study is an observational case-control study. Methods. Singers at training levels from undergraduate university students through professionals sang an A3-A4 scale using an /alpha:/ vowel while standing. Contact quotient (CQEGG), amplitudes of the first five harmonics (H1-H5), and the number of the harmonics with greatest energy in the frequency region around 3000 Hz were measured at vibrato crests and troughs for each note. Results. The data at the vibrato crests and troughs exhibited similar patterns across the notes that differed in the percentage CQEGG and harmonic amplitude. The mean CQEGG exhibited a slight decline from the lowest note to the highest, with a few of the singers exhibiting different patterns. The strongest harmonic for the four lowest notes was H3 with a transition to H2 being strongest for the four highest notes. Conclusions. The patterns of all the singers' averaged glottal and vocal tract adjustments through their primo passaggio generally followed what was hypothesized for the CQEGG, harmonic amplitudes, and harmonic of the frequency region around 3000 Hz. However, differences occurred between the measurements at the vibrato peaks and troughs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) propose that rumination about a trauma may increase particular symptom clusters. One type of rumination, termed counterfactual thinking (CFT), refers to thinking of alternative outcomes for an event. CFT centered on a trauma is thought to increase intrusions, negative alterations in mood and cognitions (NAMC), and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity (AAR). The theorized relations between CFT and specific symptom clusters have not been thoroughly investigated. Also, past work has not evaluated whether the relation is confounded by depressive symptoms, age, gender, or number of traumatic events experienced. Method: The current study examined the unique associations between CFT and PTSD symptom clusters according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) in 51 trauma-exposed treatment-seeking individuals. Results: As predicted, CFT was associated with all PTSD symptom clusters. After controlling for common predictors of PTSD symptom severity (i.e., age, depressive symptoms, and number of traumatic life events endorsed), we found CFT to be significantly associated with the intrusion and avoidance symptom clusters but not the AAR or NAMC symptom clusters. Conclusions: Results from the present study provide further support for the role of rumination in specific PTSD symptom clusters above and beyond symptoms of depression, age, and number of traumatic life events endorsed. Future work may consider investigating interventions to reduce rumination in PTSD.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper, we analyze the holographic cosmology using a M2-M5 brane configuration. In this configuration, a M2-brane will be placed in between a M5-brane and an anti-M5-brane. The M2-brane will act as a channel for energy to flow from an anti-M5-brane to a M5-brane, and this will increase the degrees of freedom on the M5-brane causing inflation. The inflation will end when the M5-brane and anti-M5-brane get separated. However, at a later stage the distance between the M5-brane and the anti-M5-bran can reduce and this will cause the formation of tachyonic states. These tachyonic states will again open a bridge between the M5-branes and the anti-M5-branes, which will cause further acceleration of the universe. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A variety of business sectors have been buffeted by the diffusion of mobile technology, a trend that presents a variety of difficult challenges but interesting opportunities to marketers. One such opportunity is gamification, which, one hopes, will enhance appeal to mobile consumers. Our sense from both personal experience and the literature is that the gamified mobile apps currently offered by firms mostly miss the mark. We provide a systematic overview of game design and note how principles derived from that field are highly applicable to gamification in mobile marketing settings. We are aided by the work of Schell (2008), whose Elemental Game Tetrad Model allows us to offer a coherent look at how gamification should affect mobile marketing outcomes.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: This study used the Scheme of Change for Sport Psychology Practice (SCSPP; Samuel & Tenenbaum, 2011a) to examine athletes' and coaches' personal characteristics, perceptions of, coping with, and perceived outcome of the London 2012 Olympic Games (OGs). We also contrasted several subgroups (e.g., Olympic and Paralympic athletes) in certain variables, and examined the decision-making and support systems involved in the OGs change process. Design and methods: A cross-sectional and retrospective design was used. Israeli Olympic and Paralympic athletes and coaches (N = 61) completed measures of change-event experiences (Samuel & Tenenbaum, 2011b) and athletic/coaching identity (AI/CI; Brewer & Cornelius, 2001) two years after the London 2012 OGs. Results: Olympic athletes trained more, and had higher motivation and AI than Paralympic athletes. The OGs were perceived as a significant and positive change-event in the participants' careers. AI/CI was associated with the perceived significance of the OGs. At the time of Olympic qualification, the participants tended either to ignore this change-event or cope with it independently. Most participants reported making a decision to change related to adjustment and coping. Professional support was mainly available prior to and during the OGs. During this experience the participants did not consider using sport psychology services, but retrospectively, valued the usefulness of this support. Athletes' motivation after the OGs was predicted from their satisfaction of coping, and their perceived outcome of this change-event was predicted from their satisfaction of competition results. Conclusions: Psychological support must be provided as part of the Olympic cycle, especially in promoting a decision to change. Maintaining realistic expectations may be critical for facilitating a positive perception of this change-event. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Method: Elite soccer coaches (n = 6) and players (n = 3) were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. An inductive thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. Results: Four themes related to team chemistry components were identified: (1) members' characteristics (i.e., demographic data, on-field characteristics, and member's ego), (2) coach players interactions (i.e., professional interaction and emotional intelligence of coaches), (3) interactions among the players (i.e., professional understanding, efficacy beliefs, team cohesion, players' emotional intelligence, team roles, and goals), and (4) interactions with environmental factors (i.e., owners, management, fans, and media). Conclusions: The cognitive components of the team chemistry model were clustered to establish a conceptual framework of SMM. Furthermore, the cognitive-affective-social-behavioral linkage of team chemistry and athletic performance is examined in light of the emerged model and conceptual framework. Implications and future directions are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This teaching note draws on the experience of the author in teaching qualitative methods to social worker students across BSW, MSW, and doctoral levels using four different approaches. The approaches are (1) a single class session within general research class; (2) a one-semester doctoral-level class taught a research team; (3) study abroad using visual qualitative inquiry; and (4) project-based, completing a program evaluation. The four individual methods are examined. Some progress has been made in the single session format, and a suggestion for including experiential exercise is offered. Challenges and outcomes of the semester-long doctoral class are noted, including extensive time and labor burdens. The study abroad model includes specifics to teaching in another country such as allowing for reflection time to process the experience. Finally, details of the research project model indicate student responses and interactions with course work. The author describes commonalities and outcomes from all four approaches and explores some existing, though sparse, literature on teaching qualitative methods to social work students. The author, while acknowledging the limitations of these case studies, concludes that experiential learning methods are optimum and there are positive aspects to the team format when employed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A 32 T all-superconductive magnet with high field REBCO inner coils is under development at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, Florida, USA. As part of the development activity, two prototype coils with full scale radial dimensions and final design features, but with reduced axial length were constructed. The prototype coils consist of six dry-wound double pancakes modules with uninsulated conductor and insulated stainless steel cowind. Quench studies on one of the prototype coils at 4.2 K in self-field and in a background magnetic field of 15 T were performed by activating a set of quench protection heaters. In this paper, we present a numerical analysis of the experimental results of the quench tests of one of the prototype coils. The numerical analysis was carried out through a coupled electro-thermal FEM model developed at the University of Bologna. The model is based on the coupling with distributed contact resistances of the coil pancakes described as 2D elements. A homogenization procedure of the REBCO tape and other coil materials is presented, which allows reducing the number of degrees of freedom and the computational effort. The model is applied to the analysis of the current and voltage evolutions during the experimental quench tests on the prototype coil.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We present a broad study by multiple techniques of the critical current and critical current density of a small but representative set of nominally identical commercial RE123 (REBa2Cu3O7-delta, RE = rare Earth, here Y and Gd) coated conductors (CC) recently fabricated by SuperPower Inc. to the same nominal high pinning specification with BaZrO3 and RE2O3 nanoprecipitate pinning centers. With high-field low-temperature applications to magnet technology in mind, we address the nature of their tape-to-tape variations and length-wise I-c inhomogeneities by measurements on a scale of about 2 cm rather than the 5 m scale normally supplied by the vendor and address the question of whether these variations have their origin in cross-sectional or in vortex pinning variations. Our principal method has been a continuous measurement transport critical current tool (YateStar) that applies about 0.5 T perpendicular and parallel to the tape at 77 K, thus allowing variations of c-axis and ab-plane properties to be clearly distinguished in the temperature and field regime where strong pinning defects are obvious. We also find such infield measurements at 77 K to be more valuable in predicting 4.2 K, high-field properties than self-field, 77 K properties because the pinning centers controlling 77 K performance play a decisive role in introducing point defects that also add strongly to J(c) at 4.2 K. We find that the dominant source of I-c variation is due to pinning center fluctuations that control J(c), rather than to production defects that locally reduce the active cross-section. Given the 5-10 nm scale of these pinning centers, it appears that the route to greater I-c homogeneity is through more stringent control of the REBCO growth conditions in these Zr-doped coated conductors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "One of the biggest challenges in developing conductor on round core (CORC (R)) magnet cables for use in the next generation of accelerator magnets is raising their engineering current density J(E) to approach 600 A mm(-2) at 20 T, while maintaining their flexibility. One route to increase J(E) could be to add more RE-Ba2Cu3O7-delta coated conductors to the cable, but this would increase the cable size and reduce its flexibility. The preferred route to higher J(E) is a reduction in diameter of the CORC (R) cable, while maintaining the number of tapes wound into the cable. The availability of very thin tapes containing substrates of 30 mu m thickness enabled us to wind a 5.1 mm diameter CORC (R) cable from 50 coated conductors, while maintaining a tape critical current Ic of about 97% after cabling. The cable I-c was 7030 A at 4.2 K in a background field of 17 T, corresponding to a J(E) of 344 A mm(-2), which is the highest performance of any CORC (R) cable so far. The magnetic field dependence allowed us to extrapolate the cable performance to 20 T to predict an I-c of 5654 A and a J(E) of 309 A mm(-2). The results clearly show that rapid progress is being made on overcoming the J(E) hurdle for use of CORC (R) cables in the next generation of accelerator magnets. Further optimization of the cable layout will likely increase J(E) towards 600 A mm(-2) at 20 T in the near future, while further reduction in cable size will also make them even more flexible.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The present paper reports on our effort to characterize vortical interactions in complex fluid flows through the use of network analysis. In particular, we examine the vortex interactions in two-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence and find that the vortical-interaction network can be characterized by a weighted scale-free network. It is found that the turbulent flow network retains its scale-free behaviour until the characteristic value of circulation reaches a critical value. Furthermore, we show that the two-dimensional turbulence network is resilient against random perturbations, but can be greatly influenced when forcing is focused towards the vortical structures, which are categorized as network hubs. These findings can serve as a network-analytic foundation to examine complex geophysical and thin-film flows and take advantage of the rapidly growing field of network theory, which complements ongoing turbulence research based on vortex dynamics, hydrodynamic stability, and statistics. While additional work is essential to extend the mathematical tools from network analysis to extract deeper physical insights of turbulence, an understanding of turbulence based on the interaction-based network-theoretic framework presents a promising alternative in turbulence modelling and control efforts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Dalle Ave et al (2016) provide a valuable overview of several protocols for heart transplantation after circulatory death. However, their analysis of the compatibility of heart donation after circulatory death (DCD) with the dead donor rule (DDR) is flawed. Their permanence-based criteria for death, which depart substantially from established law and bioethics, are ad hoc and unfounded. Furthermore, their analysis is self-defeating, because it undercuts the central motivation for DDR as both a legal and a moral constraint, rendering the DDR vacuous and trivial. Rather than devise new and ad hoc criteria for death for the purpose of rendering DCD nominally consistent with DDR, we contend that the best approach is to explicitly abandon DDR.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Genome instability is a potential limitation to the research and therapeutic application of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Observed genomic variations reflect the combined activities of DNA damage, cellular DNA damage response (DDR), and selection pressure in culture. To understand the contribution of DDR on the distribution of copy number variations (CNVs) in iPSCs, we mapped CNVs of iPSCs with mutations in the central DDR gene ATM onto genome organization landscapes defined by genome-wide replication timing profiles. We show that following reprogramming the early and late replicating genome is differentially affected by CNVs in ATM-deficient iPSCs relative to wild-type iPSCs. Specifically, the early replicating regions had increased CNV losses during retroviral (RV) reprogramming. This differential CNV distribution was not present after later passage or after episomal reprogramming. Comparison of different reprogramming methods in the setting of defective DDR reveals unique vulnerability of early replicating open chromatin to RV vectors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Supported treatments are not broadly available, prompting the need for effective training of front-line providers. Observational methods for assessing training success are resource- and time-intensive, and brief self-reports of comprehension are prone to bias and poor correspondence with practice. The present study presents a preliminary psychometric evaluation of a novel alternative method to assessing trainee comprehension of and clinical reasoning in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety disorders, the Assessment of Clinical decision-making in Evidence-based treatment for Child Anxiety and Related and Disorders (ACE CARD). The ACE CARD, developed in consultation with a panel of child anxiety experts, presents respondents with clinical vignettes describing prototypical anxious youth at various points of CBT treatment and has respondents select which of 4 response options is most consistent with the CBT model of child anxiety treatment. In a sample of novice trainees and experts in CBT for anxiety (N = 54), results suggest the measure can discriminate across levels of clinical expertise. Experts performed significantly better than trainees (d = .60, p < .001), although 3 of the vignettes were largely responsible for group differences. Future iterations of the ACE CARD are needed to remove items with poor discriminating properties and to add additional items with greater difficulty. With continued support, vignette-based assessment approaches may prove to have a meaningful role in dissemination efforts as brief, resource-efficient proxies of CBT competence.",

      "Abstract Note" : "There is great deal of debate about the possible role of adult-born hippocampal cells in the prevention of depression and related mood disorders. We first showed that zinc supplementation prevents the development of the depression-like behavior anhedonia associated with an animal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This work then examined the effect of zinc supplementation on the proliferation of new cells in the hippocampus that have the potential to participate in neurogenesis. Rats were fed a zinc adequate (ZA, 30 ppm) or zinc supplemented (ZS, 180 ppm) diet for 4 wk followed by TBI using controlled cortical impact. Stereological counts of EdU-positive cells showed that TBI doubled the density of proliferating cells 24 h post-injury (p < 0.05), and supplemental zinc significantly increased this by an additional 2-fold (p < 0.0001). While the survival of these proliferating cells decreased at the same rate in ZA and in ZS rats after injury, the total density of newly born cells was approximately 60% higher in supplemented rats 1 wk after TBI. Furthermore, chronic zinc supplementation resulted in significant increases in the density of new doublecortin-positive neurons one week post-TBI that were maintained for 4 wk after injury (p < 0.01). While the effect of zinc supplementation on neuronal precursor cells in the hippocampus was robust, use of targeted irradiation to eliminate these cells after zinc supplementation and TBI revealed that these cells are not the sole mechanism through which zinc acts to prevent depression associated with brain injury, and suggest that other zinc dependent mechanisms are needed for the antidepressant effect of zinc in this model of TBI.

      "Abstract Note" : "There has been significant interest in examining the developmental factors that predispose individuals to chronic criminal offending. This body of research has identified some social-environmental risk factors as potentially important. At the same time, the research producing these results has generally failed to employ genetically sensitive research designs, thereby potentially generating biased parameter estimates. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by using both a standard social science methodology (SSSM) and two separate genetically informative research designs to examine whether parent, teacher, and peer risk factors are associated with four maladaptive outcomes: arrests, low IQ, reduced self-control, and a combined measure of the truly disadvantaged. Analysis of twin pairs drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health revealed that the SSSMs produced upwardly biased estimates of the impact of social-environmental influences on each of the four outcomes. Once genetic factors were controlled, the effect of social-environmental risk was reduced (but remained significant in certain cases). We conclude by discussing these findings in the context of criminal justice policy and their implications for future criminological research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose. The appropriate mode of exercise training for cancer cachexia is not well established. Using the colon-26 (C26) mouse model of cancer cachexia, we defined and compared the skeletal muscle responses to aerobic and resistance training. Methods. Twelve-month old Balb/c mice were initially assigned to control, aerobic training (AT; wheel running), or resistance training (RT; ladder climbing) (n = 16-17/group). After 8 weeks of training, half of each group was injected with C26 tumor cells, followed by 3 additional weeks of training. Body composition and neuromuscular function was evaluated pre- and post-training. Muscles were collected post-training and analyzed for fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), Akt mTOR signaling, and expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and myogenic regulatory factors. Results. Total body mass decreased (p < 0.05) in C26 (-8%), AT + C26 (-18%), and RT + C26 (-15%) but not control. Sensorimotor function declined (p < 0.05) in control (-16%), C26 (-13%), and RT + C26 (-23%) but not AT + C26. Similarly, strength/body weight decreased (p < 0.05) in control (-7%), C26 (-21%), and RT + C26 (-10%) but not AT + C26. Gastrocnemius mass/body weight tended to be greater in AT + C26 vs. C26 (+6%, p = 0.09). Enlargement of the spleen was partially corrected in AT + C26 (-27% vs. C26, p < 0.05). Fiber CSA was lower in all C26 groups vs. control (-32% to 46%, p < 0.05); however, the effect size calculated from C26 and AT + C26 was large (+24%, d = 1.04). Phosphorylated levels of mTOR in AT + C26 exceeded C26 (+32%, p < 0.05). RT + C26 showed greater mRNA expression (p < 0.05) of IGF-IEa (+79%) and myogenin (+126%) with a strong tendency for greater IGF-IEb (+127%, p = 0.069) vs. control. Conclusions. Aerobic or resistance training was unable to prevent tumor-induced body weight loss. However, aerobic training may have preserved function, reduced the inflammatory response of the spleen, and marginally rescued muscle mass possibly through activation of mTOR. Aerobic training may therefore have therpeutic value for patients with cancer cachexia. In contrast, resistance training induced the expression of genes associated with muscle damage and repair. This gene response may be supportive of excessive stress generated by high resistance loading in a tumor-bearing state. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study investigated whether beginning nonnative learners of Chinese can use phonological and semantic information of radicals to learn the sounds and meanings of new Chinese characters. Thirty-four seventh- and eighth-grade American adolescents, who received intensive Chinese instruction for one semester, were taught 16 compound pseudocharacters paired with novel pictures over three learning trials. After each learning trial, students were asked to produce the sounds and meanings of pseudocharacters in which semantic transparency and phonetic regularity of radicals were manipulated. Results showed a facilitation effect of transparent semantic radicals in learning character meanings in early trials. There was a trend that students learned to read regular and transparent characters better than irregular and opaque characters. The ability to learn orthography-pronunciation association uniquely predicted Chinese word reading after controlling for semantic and phonetic radical knowledge. These findings suggest a predominant use of semantic strategies and the importance of orthography to phonology mappings in learning to read Chinese for beginning nonnative learners of Chinese.",

Generally, scholars believe that public opinion and youth justice policies are linked. It is also believed that crime saliencefear and perceived risk of victimizationis linked to public opinion about youth sanctions. To test these widely held beliefs, this study examines public opinion about youth justice policies by exploring the impact of crime salience on public support for child saving versus youth punishment. This study expands on prior literature by also considering the public's willingness to pay (WTP) for the youth justice policies they prefer. Results indicate that fear increases punitiveness, WTP for youth justice policies generally, and, more specifically, the WTP for youth punishment.

Shifting the focus to writing, this article addresses the assessment of writing for students in kindergarten through second grade. Using curriculum-based measurement of written expression for beginning writers, teachers can measure growth of smaller increments of writing skill development (i.e., number of words written in a given time or using correctly sequenced letters or words) and may use this method repeatedly across the school year to show growth and identify weakness in students' early writing skills.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Markov models widely used in hydrology are not adequate for drought analysis because they are independent of previous processes in dealing with associated significant autocorrelations of hydrological events. Therefore, use of semi-Markov model becomes more realistic for studying droughts processes due to dynamics of the system. An embedded Markov-based model was developed to assess chances of occurrence of hydrological droughts in which waiting times of the series were defined explicitly. This presents a more global parametric method to define drought duration compared to those frequently used. This model was applied to monthly streamflow series of Apalachicola River, Chattahoochee River and Flint River in Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin, located in southeastern USA. The streamflow conditions below the mean resulting to Near Drought and Critical Drought conditions were considered crucial. Drought occurrence probabilities and corresponding flows indicate a 42 % chance of Near Drought condition and 18 % chance of Critical Drought condition, with transition time of about 1.8 months. The model results were validated using last ten-year data series. Correlation coefficient (r) and root-mean-square error statistics demonstrate that the model can predict Near Drought and Critical Drought conditions with high accuracy, resulting in errors less than 5 % statistical significance. The method is capable of preserving longer memory persistence of historic flow trends in the ACF River Basin, and gives an effective recursive equation of defining occurrence of droughts. The semi-Markov model developed in this work will provide valuable lead in estimating similar drought indices in other related river systems.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Sediment is an important factor for excavation, dredging and maintenance of Hengmen Eastern Access Channel in Pearl River Estuary. As storm surge is considered as an important role in determining sediment re-suspension and transport, as well as creating landforms in the areas of estuary and coast, along with the storm surge disaster damage in Pearl River Estuary is one of the most serious events in China, reasonable simulation of storm-induced sediment concentration, transport and channel siltation in Hengmen Eastern Access Channel is of much significance. Based on the feasibility condition of less research on numerical simulation of storm-induced sediment concentration and transport, especially channel siltation in the Pearl River Estuary, using a curvilinear grid, a nested and coupled model which combines typhoon model, hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW), wave model (Delft3D-WAVE) and sediment transport model (Delft3D-SED) was set up for the region of Pearl River Estuary. After a series of model verifications, which showed that this coupled model performed well to reflect the characteristics of the typhoon field, tidal currents, wave height, storm surge, distribution of suspended sediment in the studied region, the model was applied to study the storm-induced sediment concentration and transport in Hengmen Eastern Access Channel. Through simulation of one extra tropical storm surge process with this coupled numerical model, the storm-induced sediment concentration and transport in Hengmen Eastern Access Channel were studied, and the storm-induced erosion and deposition were further discussed. Results showed that the effect of storm surge on sediment concentration, transport and siltation was significant. Under the influence of storm surge, the velocity and bed stress around Hengmen Eastern Access Channel increased significantly, which led the re-suspension and transport of sediment, and thus, the higher sediment concentration and more channel siltation occurred. By running this coupled model, the simulated results can be employed in the optimum decision making of Hengmen Eastern Access Channel Regulation Project.",

Moderate to large effect sizes on researcher-developed measures for cognitive strategy interventions were reported. Interventions that utilized graphic organizers as study guides to support social studies learning were also associated with improved outcomes. The findings are considered within the context of limited implementation of standardized measures. The authors extend findings from previous research by reporting a paucity of interventions to enhance higher-level cognitive and comprehension skills. The majority of reviewed studies targeted fact acquisition and main idea identification, and overall encouraging findings were noted for these skills.

      "Abstract Note" : "An increasing number of consumers rely on online reviews to make purchase decisions in today's global service industry. In this article, we investigate the impact of power on a consumer's willingness to spread word-of-mouth (WOM) by posting an online review. Drawing on self-enhancement theory, which suggests that an individual is motivated to spread WOM in order to boost his or her self-image, and the agentic versus communal theory of power, we argue that the impact of power is moderated by the valence of the customer's service experience, and its congruity with that of other forum users. Results from three studies in hotel and restaurant contexts indicate that powerless consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Conversely, powerful consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the overriding consensus is negative. Further, such results hold only for positive (vs. negative) service experiences. Managerially, our findings suggest that introducing power mechanisms such as influence rankings or helpful votes into online consumer forums may shape review posting behaviors. Service marketers and social media managers need to be aware that some customer segments are not inclined to post positive online reviews. As indicated by our findings, powerful consumers, such as those with high helpful ratings or elite reviewer status, are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is negative. Conversely, powerless consumers, such as those with low helpful ratings or junior reviewer status, might be more inclined to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Based on our findings, we also discussed the theoretical contributions, limitations, and ideas for future research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hazardous alcohol consumption has been frequently reported among women with HIV infection and is associated with a variety of negative health consequences. Treatments to reduce alcohol use may bring in health benefits. However, little is known regarding the utilization of alcohol treatment services among HIV + women with hazardous drinking. Using data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), this study assessed utilization of any alcohol treatment in the past 6 months and performed multivariable logistic regression to determine correlates of receipt of any alcohol treatment. Among 474 HIV+ women reporting recent hazardous drinking, less than one in five (19%) reported recent utilization of any alcohol treatment. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was the most commonly reported (12.9%), followed by inpatient detoxification (9.9%) and outpatient alcohol treatment program (7.0%). Half (51%) receiving any alcohol treatment reported utilization of multiple treatments. Multivariable analyses found alcohol treatment was more often utilized by those who had social support (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00 to 2.83), fewer economic resources (income $12,000 vs. >$12,000, OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.53 to 6.27), higher levels of drinking (16-35 drinks/week vs. 12-15 drinks/week, OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.47 to 6.21; 36+ drinks/week vs. 12-15 drinks/week, OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 2.03 to 9.59), and those who reported any illicit drug use (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.44 to 534). More efforts are needed to enhance the utilization of alcohol treatment. Our findings highlight the unique profile of those who utilized alcohol treatment. Such information is vital to improve treatment delivery to address unmet need in this particular population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "How does forgiveness predict the likelihood of reoffending? One survey study, one experiment, one 4-year longitudinal study, and one 2-week diary study examined the implications of forgiveness for reoffending in relationships. In all four studies, agreeableness interacted with partner forgiveness to predict subsequent offending; partner forgiveness was negatively associated with subsequent offending among more agreeable people but positively associated with subsequent offending among less agreeable people. Furthermore, Study 4 demonstrated a unique mechanism of each simple effect; relatively agreeable people engaged in fewer transgressions against more forgiving partners because they felt obligated to refrain from transgressing against such partners whereas relatively disagreeable people engaged in more transgressions against more forgiving partners because they perceived those partners were less easily angered. These studies indicate that completely understanding the intrapersonal and interpersonal consequences of forgiveness requires recognizing the dyadic nature of forgiveness and attending to qualities of the offender.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Electronic, geometric, and magnetic structures of doped semiconductor clusters Cd9-nSe9Mnn and Cd9-nSe9Fen (n = 0-9) are studied using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation. Polarizability, band gap widths, and density of states are obtained for the lowest total energy states in both series. The polarizability behavior is quite unexpected since the successive Mn and Fe substitutions lead to decreasing polarizability of the substituted clusters despite the metal atoms possessing substantially higher polarizabilities than the substituted Cd atoms. The band gap behavior is different for the two substitution types; namely, Fe substitutions resulted in a drastic decrease in the band gap width after the first substitution whereas the Mn substitutions produced a nearly monotonic decrease in the band gap width as the number of substituting atoms increased. It is found that the band gap of Cd9-nSe9Fen becomes smaller than that of the free-standing Fe-9 cluster even at moderate amounts of Fe substitutions. It was also shown that in both series the metal atoms segregate as the number of substitutions increases and produce metallic clusters with Se atoms acting as ligands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "A novel non-intrusive reduced order model (NIROM) for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) has been developed. The model is based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation method. The method is independent of the governing equations, therefore, it does not require modifications to the source code. This is the first time that a NIROM was constructed for FSI phenomena using POD and RBF interpolation method. Another novelty of this work is the first implementation of the FSI NIROM under the framework of an unstructured mesh finite element multi-phase model (Fluidity) and a combined finite-discrete element method based solid model (Y2D). The capability of this new NIROM for FSI is numerically illustrated in three coupling simulations: a one-way coupling case (flow past a cylinder), a two-way coupling case (a free-falling cylinder in water) and a vortex-induced vibration of an elastic beam test case. It is shown that the FSI NIROM results in a large CPU time reduction by several orders of magnitude while the dominant details of the high fidelity model are captured. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Modern society relies heavily upon complex and widespread electric grids. In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communication networks, and information technologies (IT) have been integrated into the electric grid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these new technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic, social, and political impacts of large-scale power system outages, the grid must be resilient in addition of being robust and reliable. The concept of a power system's cyber-physical resilience centers around maintaining critical functionality of the system backbone in the presence of unexpected extreme disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid; it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures, cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience. This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected extreme disturbances and hazards and leveraging distributed energy resources. The concepts of service availability and quality are not new, but many recognize the need of resilience in maintaining essential services to critical loads, for example to allow home refrigerators to operate for food conservation in the aftermath of a hurricane landfall. By providing a comprehensive definition of power system resilience, this paper paves the way for creating appropriate and effective resilience standards and metrics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper describes propagation of near atmospheric nitrogen gas that rushes into a liquid helium (LHe) cooled vacuum tube after the tube suddenly loses vacuum. The loss-of-vacuum scenario resembles accidental venting of atmospheric air to the beam-line of a superconducting particle accelerator and is investigated to understand how the in-flowing air will propagate in such geometry. In controlled experiments, we simulated loss of vacuum by rapidly venting a large reservoir of nitrogen gas (a substitute for air) to a vacuum tube immersed in a LHe bath at 4.2 K. The resulting rise in the tube pressure and temperature were measured by pressure probes and thermometers arranged along the tube length. The data show that the propagation of nitrogen gas in the LHe cooled vacuum tube is orders of magnitude slower than in the same tube at room temperature. Interestingly, the gas front speed in the LHe cooled tube also decreases along the tube. A gas propagation model developed by employing conservation of mass identifies mass transfer (gas condensation in the tube) as the principal cause of the slow propagation as well as of the front deceleration. Some limitations of this analytical model are discussed in the context of quantifying the propagation speed. The speed obtained from direct measurements is seen to decrease exponentially along the tube. This exponential decay form of the propagation speed well represents the data from experiments that have different mass flow rates of nitrogen gas flowing into the vacuum tube after venting.

In a cross-sectional design, we examined AS facets (physical, cognitive, and social concerns) in relation to tobacco use, abstinence-related problems, and cognitions in 473 treatment-seeking smokers. After controlling for sex, race, age, educational attainment, hypertension status, and neuroticism, linear regression models indicated that AS physical and cognitive concerns were associated with tobacco dependence severity (beta = .13-.14, p < .01), particularly the severity of persistent smoking regardless of context or time of day (beta = .14-.17, p < .01). All three AS facets were related to more severe problems during past quit attempts (beta = .23-.27, p < .001). AS cognitive and social concerns were related to negative affect reduction smoking motives beta = .14,p < .01), but only the social concerns aspect of AS was related to pleasurable relaxation smoking motives and positive and negative reinforcement-related smoking outcome expectancies (beta = .14-.17, p < .01). These data suggest that AS physical and cognitive concerns are associated with negative reinforcement-related smoking variables (e.g., abstinence-related problems), whereas the social concerns aspect of AS is associated with positive and negative reinforcement-related smoking variables. Together with past findings, current findings can usefully guide AS-oriented smoking cessation treatment development and refinement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Suicide constitutes a significant public health burden as global suicide rates continue to increase. Thus, it is crucial to identify malleable suicide risk factors to develop prevention protocols. Anxiety sensitivity, or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a potential malleable risk factor for the development of suicidal ideation. The Depression-Distress Amplification Model (DDAM) posits that the anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns (ASCC) subfactor interacts with depressive symptoms to amplify the effects of depression and lead to suicidal ideation. The current study tested the DDAM across the two most widely-replicated factors of depressive symptoms (cognitive and affective/somatic) in comparison to a risk factor mediation model where ASCC are related to suicidal ideation via depressive symptoms. Participants included 295 clinical outpatients from a community clinic. The interaction between ASCC and depressive symptoms in the prediction of suicidal ideation was not significant for either cognitive or affective/somatic symptoms of depression. However, results revealed a significant indirect effect of ASCC through cognitive symptoms of depression in the prediction of suicidal ideation. These cross sectional findings are not consistent with the DDAM. Rather, the relationship may be better conceptualized with a model in which ASCC is related to suicidal ideation via cognitive symptoms of depression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Magnetic-field induced modifications of reflectance are very pronounced in the infrared part of the spectrum, indicating strong electron-phonon coupling. This coupling causes an asymmetric line-shape of the 60 cm(-1) phonon mode, and is analyzed within the Fano formalism. The analysis reveals that the Fano asymmetry parameter (q) changes sign when the cyclotron resonance is degenerate with the phonon mode.

      "Abstract Note" : "Metazoan development requires coordination of signaling pathways to regulate patterns of gene expression. In Drosophila, the wing imaginal disc provides an excellent model for the study of how signaling pathways interact to regulate pattern formation. The determination of the dorsal-ventral (DV) boundary of the wing disc depends on the Notch pathway, which is activated along the DV boundary and induces the expression of the homeobox transcription factor, Cut. Here, we show that Broad (Br), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is also involved in regulating Cut expression in the DV boundary region. However, Br expression is not regulated by Notch signaling in wing discs, while ecdysone signaling is the upstream signal that induces Br for Cut upregulation. Also, we find that the ecdysone-Br cascade upregulates cut-lacZ expression, a reporter containing a 2.7 kb cut enhancer region, implying that ecdysone signaling, similar to Notch, regulates cut at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our findings reveal that the Notch and ecdysone signaling pathways synergistically regulate Cut expression for proper DV boundary formation in the wing disc. Additionally, we show br promotes Delta, a Notch ligand, near the DV boundary to suppress aberrant high Notch activity, indicating further interaction between the two pathways for DV patterning of the wing disc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Surface drifters and virtual particles are used to investigate transport between seven coastal regions in the central and southern Adriatic Sea to estimate the degree to which these regions function as a network. Alongshore coastal currents and cyclonic gyres are the primary circulation features that connected regions in the Adriatic Sea. The historical drifter observations span 25 years and, thus, provide estimates of transport between regions realized by the mean surface circulation. The virtual particle trajectories and a dedicated drifter experiment show that southeasterly Sirocco winds can drive eastward cross-Adriatic transport from the Italian coast near the Gargano Promontory to the Dalmatian Islands in Croatia. Southeasterly winds disrupt alongshore transport on the west coast. Northwesterly Mistral winds enhanced east-to-west transport and resulted in stronger southeastward coastal currents in the western Adriatic current (WAC) and export to the northern Ionian Sea. The central Italian regions showed strong connections from north to south, likely realized by alongshore transport in the WAC. Alongshore, downstream transport was weaker on the east coast, likely due to the more complex topography introduced by the Dalmatian Islands of Croatia. Cross-Adriatic connection percentages were higher for east-to-west transport. Cross-Adriatic transport, in general, occurred via the cyclonic sub-gyres, with westward (eastward) transport observed in the northern (southern) arms of the central and southern gyres.

      "Abstract Note" : "Nitrogen-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (N-TiO2 NPs) with anatase phase were synthesized by sol gel method using a single precursor containing titanium (IV) terbutoxide, glacial acetic acid, sodium dodecyl sulphate, ammonia, and urea. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals the nanocrystalline nature with anatase phase of all the samples. The particle size of all samples was found in the range of 5-12 nm using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). UV-visible absorption measurements examined that the optical band gap of the doped samples decrease with increase in dopant concentration from 0.0 to 7.0 mol%. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy dispersive atomic X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy was employed to analyse the morphology and chemical composition of these N-TiO2 NPs. The photocatalytic activity of bare/doped TiO2 samples was demonstrated for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye tinder direct sunlight irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation was monitored by measuring the kinetic parameters based on UV-visible spectroscopy as well as the chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the course of the reaction. The effect of dye concentration and pH of the solution on the photocatalytic degradation reaction in the presence of colloidal bare/doped TiO2 were also studied. The N-TiO2 catalyst, with a nitrogen concentration of 7.0 mol%, showed the highest activity for photocatalytic mineralization of dye at acidic or alkaline medium than neutral condition under solar light irradiation directly.

      "Abstract Note" : "The authors present a multistage testing procedure for a truck tyre. Quasi-static, dynamic and strongly dynamic tests were carried out including: radial deflection test, bounce test and blast loading test. Results from experiments and finite element analyses were compared and showed acceptable accuracy in terms of deformation (first and second tests) and failure (third test). A novel and detailed discrete model of the tyre was developed for simulations with cord arrangements that realistically correspond to the actual tyre. Firstly, however, the experimental material properties assessment is discussed with a special attention on rubber parts of the tyre. The tabulated Simplified Rubber Material model was used for simulating the hyperplastic behaviour of the tyre. A number of tests were conducted from the lowest strain rate to the highest to obtain the required stress-strain curves for the tyre rubber. Quasi-static uniaxial tests were carried out, whereas experimental tests under dynamic conditions were performed using the Split Hopkinson pressure bars (with aluminium alloy Al 7075-T6 and polymathic methacrylate bars). Moreover, rubber material properties were correlated with experimental test data. The proposed methodology can be very useful in tyre modelling in static problems as well as in those where dynamic effects play an essential role. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Cross-linked hybrid membranes based on composites of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and low-hydroxylated fullerenol C-60(OH)(12) have been prepared by two different procedures. To improve the dispersion of the functionalized fullerene in the PVA network, the hydrodynamic properties of PVA, fullerenol and PVA/fullerenol composites in dilute solutions were studied by viscometry and dynamic light scattering. It was shown that the aggregate sizes increased with the increase of fullerenol content in the PVA/fullerenol composite solutions. The effect of low-hydroxylated fullerenol on the structure and morphology of PVA membranes was investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. It was observed that the incorporation of 5 wt.% fullerenol and cross-linking with maleic acid led to a more uniform distribution of the amorphous PVA phase. As a result, membrane transport characteristics were improved for the dehydration of n-butanol-water mixtures by pervaporation. The PVA membranes containing 35 wt.% maleic acid and 5 wt.% fullerenol exhibited the best transport properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Both materials are produced using the iodine vapor phase transport method and the resulting crystals are exfoliable. The bulk electrical transport and thermodynamic properties indicate Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature for both compounds. Quantum oscillations are observed in magnetization measurements for fields applied parallel but not perpendicular to the c-axis, suggesting that the Fermi surfaces are quasi-two dimensional. Frequencies are determined from quantum oscillations for several parts of the Fermi surfaces. Lifshitz-Kosevich fits to the temperature dependent amplitudes of the oscillations reveal small effective masses, with a particularly small value m* = 0.046m(0) for the alpha branch of Zr2Te2P. Electronic structure calculations are in good agreement with quantum oscillation results and illustrate the effect of a stronger spin-orbit interaction going from Zr to Hf. These results suggest that by using appropriate tuning parameters this class of materials may deepen the pool of novel Dirac phenomena.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) method is introduced to cure the deficiencies of traditional spectral analysis and to give a full informational representation of nonlinear and non-stationary data. It uses a nested empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) approach to identify intrinsic amplitude and frequency modulations often present in nonlinear systems. Comparisons are first made with traditional spectrum analysis, which usually achieved its results through convolutional integral transforms based on additive expansions of an a priori determined basis, mostly under linear and stationary assumptions. Thus, for non-stationary processes, the best one could do historically was to use the time-frequency representations, in which the amplitude (or energy density) variation is still represented in terms of time. For nonlinear processes, the data can have both amplitude and frequency modulations (intra-mode and inter-mode) generated by two different mechanisms: linear additive or nonlinear multiplicative processes. As all existing spectral analysis methods are based on additive expansions, either a priori or adaptive, none of them could possibly represent the multiplicative processes. While the earlier adaptive HHT spectral analysis approach could accommodate the intra-wave nonlinearity quite remarkably, it remained that any inter-wave nonlinear multiplicative mechanisms that include cross-scale coupling and phase-lock modulations were left untreated. To resolve the multiplicative processes issue, additional dimensions in the spectrum result are needed to account for the variations in both the amplitude and frequency modulations simultaneously. HHSA accommodates all the processes: additive and multiplicative, intra-mode and inter-mode, stationary and non-stationary, linear and nonlinear interactions. The Holo prefix in HHSA denotes a multiple dimensional representation with both additive and multiplicative capabilities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this big data era, it is more urgent than ever to solve two major issues: (i) fast data transmission methods that can facilitate access to data from non-local sources and (ii) fast and efficient data analysis methods that can reveal the key information from the available data for particular purposes. Although approaches in different fields to address these two questions may differ significantly, the common part must involve data compression techniques and a fast algorithm. This paper introduces the recently developed adaptive and spatio-temporally local analysis method, namely the fast multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD), for the analysis of a large spatio-temporal dataset. The original MEEMD uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition to decompose time series at each spatial grid and then pieces together the temporal-spatial evolution of climate variability and change on naturally separated timescales, which is computationally expensive. By taking advantage of the high efficiency of the expression using principal component analysis/empirical orthogonal function analysis for spatio-temporally coherent data, we design a lossy compression method for climate data to facilitate its non-local transmission. We also explain the basic principles behind the fast MEEMD through decomposing principal components instead of original grid-wise time series to speed up computation of MEEMD. Using a typical climate dataset as an example, we demonstrate that our newly designed methods can (i) compress data with a compression rate of one to two orders; and (ii) speed-up the MEEMD algorithm by one to two orders.",

      "Abstract Note" : "While the first individuals to discover and maintain territories are generally respected as owners, under some conditions there may be ambiguity as to who got there first. Here we attempt to understand the evolutionary consequences of this ambiguity by developing a pair of game-theoretic models in which we explicitly consider rival residency-based claims to ownership. Following earlier qualitative explanations for residency effects, we assume that either the value of the territory (Model A) or an interloper's self belief that it is the owner (Model B) increases with duration of residency. Model A clearly demonstrates that if the value of a territory increases to a resident over time, so should its motivation to fight in terms of the effort it invests in fighting. Indeed, only a small increase in territory value with residency duration can be sufficient for longer established residents to win disputes, even without any arbitrary convention or other form of priority effect. Likewise, Model B shows that the observed increase in fighting persistence with residency duration can be readily explained as a consequence of increasing confidence on behalf of the interloper that it is the rightful owner. Collectively, the models help to explain some general findings long observed by empiricists, and shed light on the nature of conflicts that can arise when individuals do not have complete information about rival claims to ownership.

      "Abstract Note" : "The feasibility of determining ion mobilities from measurements conducted in non-stationary buffer gases and in the presence of dynamic and non-uniform electric fields is examined theoretically and experimentally. First, an equation of motion of an ion ensemble is derived on the basis of a solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. Subsequently, this equation of motion is applied to derive the relationship between ion mobility and arrival time for the conditions present in an ion mobility drift tube and a trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) apparatus. Finally, the theoretical analysis is tested by determining the ion mobility of compounds present in an ESI tune mix directly from experimental TIMS data. Comparison to ion mobilities measured on a drift tube shows that relative ion mobilities are currently directly amenable from TIMS experiments. The analysis further suggests that absolute ion mobilities are, in principle, directly amenable from ion mobility measurements performed with non stationary buffer gases and non-uniform and dynamic electric fields.

A large and profitable industry that has emerged catering to this need for CE that is particularly focused on the needs of licensed social workers. Quality control mechanisms in place to monitor the content and delivery of CE approved by the field of social work is relatively lax, and as a result a considerable number of social work CE programs convey content that can be labeled as pseudoscientific. We provide illustrations of currently approved social work CE courses that provide training in a variety of bizarre and unsupported assessment methods and treatments that are pseudoscientific.",

Each study examined the importance of comprehension-related variables (i.e., academic language, perspective taking, complex reasoning skill, suppression, and response to instructional dosage) in developing readers. In this commentary we apply Perfetti and Adlof's (2012) concept of comprehension-related pressure points to help us assess whether the size of relation between the comprehension-related variables and reading comprehension skill are large enough to be of practical significance for assessment and intervention. In general, we conclude that none of the comprehension-related variables investigated in the special issue meet the criteria for inclusion as a pressure point. However, we caution that decontextualized assessments of potentially important comprehension-related skills applied as predictors to generic passage variance without concern for important reader-by-text interactions may result in underestimates of the importance of reader characteristics in certain texts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Most accounts of affect and motivation in the science education literature have discussed them as relevant to, but distinct from, disciplinary pursuits. These include Pintrich's seminal work on affective and motivational factors in learning science (P. R. Pintrich,1999, 2003; P. R. Pintrich & E. De Groot,1990; P. R. Pintrich, R. W. Marx, & R. A. Boyle,1993). Our purpose here is to build on those ideas, drawing as well on accounts of scientists' practices (e.g., H. E. Gruber,1974; E. F. Keller, 1983) and of students' taking up of disciplinary pursuits (R. A. Engle & F. R. Conant,2002; R. Lehrer,2009; M. Scardamalia & C. Bereiter, 1991, 2006) to propose that affect and motivation are inherent in the disciplinary practices of science. Thus, we introduce notions of epistemic affect and epistemic motivation, and we illustrate how these are evident in a case study of a student we have followed from 4th to 7th grade. We consider how this perspective aligns with and contributes to research on interest (e.g., S. Hidi,2006; S. Hidi, K. A. Renninger, & A. Krapp,2004; C. Sansone,2009), and we discuss implications for research and instruction in science education. We argue that part of what should happen in the science class is to cultivate students' feelings and motivations within the discipline.",

Using two publically available databases on NFL player arrests, our results show that high frequency offending is rare among the arrested NFL players, that non-white players are more chronic than white players, and that the likelihood of violence is largely driven by high frequency offendingespecially among non-white players. Importantly, there appears to be no specialization-in-violence among this sample of arrested NFL players.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: To develop a multivariate method for quantifying the population representativeness across related clinical studies and a computational method for identifying and characterizing underrepresented subgroups in clinical studies. Methods: We extended a published metric named Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) to include multiple study traits for quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related studies by assuming the independence and equal importance among all study traits. On this basis, we compared the effectiveness of GIST and multivariate GIST (mGIST) qualitatively. We further developed an algorithm called \"Multivariate Underrepresented Subgroup Identification\" (MAGIC) for constructing optimal combinations of distinct value intervals of multiple traits to define underrepresented subgroups in a set of related studies. Using Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an example, we identified and extracted frequently used quantitative eligibility criteria variables in a set of clinical studies. We profiled the T2DM target population using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Results: According to the mGIST scores for four example variables, i.e., age, HbA1c, BMI, and gender, the included observational T2DM studies had superior population representativeness than the interventional T2DM studies. For the interventional T2DM studies, Phase I trials had better population representativeness than Phase III trials. People at least 65 years old with HbAlc value between 5.7% and 7.2% were particularly underrepresented in the included T2DM trials. These results confirmed well-known knowledge and demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods in population representativeness assessment. Conclusions: mGIST is effective at quantifying population representativeness of related clinical studies using multiple numeric study traits. MAGIC identifies underrepresented subgroups in clinical studies. Both data-driven methods can be used to improve the transparency of design bias in participation selection at the research community level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Given some debate on the empirical idiosyncratic risk-return relation in the literature, we reexamine the relation using a quantile regression approach based on the prospect theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky [1979]. The quantile regression approach allows the coefficient on the independent variable (idiosyncratic risk) to vary across the distribution of the dependent variable (return). Our sample consists of stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ during 1980-2010: 80,324 firm-year observations and 8,123 firms in total. The quantile regression results show that idiosyncratic risk is positively (negatively) related to returns at the high (low) quantiles of returns. The findings are consistent with the prospect theory that investors have a tendency to be less (more) willing to gamble with profits (losses). The results also demonstrate that the least-squares and least-sum optimization methods commonly used in prior research do not capture the relations between idiosyncratic risk and returns at the tail parts of the distribution of returns. Therefore, our empirical results provide new insights into the idiosyncratic risk-return relation in the literature.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Human fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) has broad therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine but has undesirable biophysical properties of low thermostability and 3 buried cysteine (Cys) residues (at positions 16, 83, and 117) that interact to promote irreversible protein unfolding under oxidizing conditions. Mutational substitution of such Cys residues eliminates reactive buried thiols but cannot be accomplished simultaneously at all 3 positions without also introducing further substantial instability. The mutational introduction of a novel Cys residue (Ala66Cys) that forms a stabilizing disulfide bond (i.e., cystine) with one of the extant Cys residues (Cys83) effectively eliminates one Cys while increasing overall stability. This increase in stability offsets the associated instability of remaining Cys substitution mutations and permits production of a Cys-free form of FGF-1 (Cys16Ser/Ala66Cys/Cys117Ala) with only minor overall instability. The addition of a further stabilizing mutation (Pro134Ala) creates a Cys-free FGF-1 mutant with essentially wild-type biophysical properties. The elimination of buried free thiols in FGF-1 can substantially increase the protein half-life in cell culture. Here, we show that the effective cell survival/mitogenic functional activity of a fully Cys-free form is also substantially increased and is equivalent to wild-type FGF-1 formulated in the presence of heparin sulfate as a stabilizing agent. The results identify this Cys-free FGF-1 mutant as an advantageous \"second generation\" form of FGF-1 for therapeutic application. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association(R).

      "Abstract Note" : "Are direct-democratic decisions more acceptable to voters than decisions arrived at through representative procedures? We conduct an experimental online vignette study with a German sample to investigate how voters' acceptance of a political decision depends on the process through which it is reached. For a set of different issues, we investigate how acceptance varies depending on whether the decision is the result of a direct-democratic institution, a party in a representative democracy, or an expert committee. Our results show that for important issues, direct democracy generates greater acceptance; this finding holds particularly for those voters who do not agree with a collectively chosen outcome. However, if the topic is of limited importance to the voters, acceptance does not differ between the mechanisms. Our results imply that a combination of representative democracy and direct democracy, conditional on the distribution of issue importance among the electorate, may be optimal with regard to acceptance of political decisions.",

Method: Investigators examined average hourly child vocalizations from daylong LENA samples for 42 SEBs and 39 monolingual English-speaking preschoolers. The relationship between average hourly child vocalizations, conversational turns, and adult words from the daylong samples and MLUw from a 50-utterance CEAF was examined and compared between groups. Results: MLUw, TNW, average hourly child vocalizations, and conversational turns were lower for young SEBs than monolingual English-speaking peers. Average hourly child vocalizations were not strongly related to MLUw performance for monolingual or SEB participants (r =.29, r =.25, respectively). In a similar manner, average hourly conversational turns were not strongly related to MLUw for either group (r =.22, r =.21, respectively). Conclusions: Young SEBs from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds showed lower average performance on LENA measures, MLUw, and TNW than monolingual English-speaking peers. MLUw from monolinguals were also lower than typical expectations when derived from CEAFs. LENA technology may be a promising tool for communication sampling with SEBs; however, more research is needed to establish norms for interpreting MLUw and TNW from selected CEAF samples.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Superconducting self-resonant spiral structures are of current interest for applications both in metamaterials and as probe coils for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for high-sensitivity chemical analysis. Accurate spiral models are available in the literature for behavior of a spiral below and up to self-resonance. However, knowledge of the higher modes is also important. We present the relationships between the spiral parameters and the multiple mode frequencies of single-sided spirals on dielectric substrates as modeled by method of moments simulation. In the absence of a ground plane, we find that the mode frequency has linear, although not necessarily harmonic, dependence on the mode number. The effect of a thick substrate can be approximated by an effective dielectric constant. However, when the thickness is less than 20% of the spiral trace width (r(outer) - r(inner)), this approximation is no longer accurate. We have developed a simple empirical formula to predict the higher modes.",

The superconducting power cable is composed of a former, a superconducting conductor, and polypropylene laminated paper (PPLP) as insulation material impregnated with liquid nitrogen (LN2). The cable joint, which is used to connect cables in joint boxes, has a central copper conductor surrounded by an insulating spacer such as epoxy and PPLP. The cryogenic parts of termination bushings are immersed in LN2 with glass-fiber reinforced plastic used as insulator. This paper reports basic dielectric characteristics of insulation materials for the HTS dc cable system mainly composed of power cable, cable joint, and termination bushing.

      "Abstract Note" : "There is strong evidence that inattention and interest are associated with academic-related skills in school-age children. However, less research has examined the unique and overlapping relations between these constructs in early childhood. This study examined the relations between inattention, literacy interest, and early literacy development in 169 preschool-age children. Inattention was assessed with both teacher reports and a continuous performance test. Literacy interest, as a component of motivation for literacy, was assessed with parent reports, and early literacy skills were assessed with the Test of Preschool Early Literacy. Inattention and literacy interest uniquely related to each other and to early literacy skills in regression analyses. Mediation analysis indicated that the relation between inattention and early literacy skills was partially mediated by children's interest in literacy. These findings indicate that literacy interest and inattentive behaviors contribute individually, directly, and indirectly to the development of early literacy skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Following 7040 students from 3rd to 8th grades, we examined gender differences in math confidence, interest, and performance and examined relations among these variables over time. Results indicate that gender differences in math confidence are larger than disparities in interest and achievement in elementary school. Structural equation models show that math performance is a consistent predictor of later confidence and interest, and there is some evidence for a reciprocal relation between confidence and performance in middle school. Relations were generally similar for boys and girls. Results raise questions about the notion that early gender differences in math interest are a driver of disparities in later math outcomes and instead suggest that math interventions for girls should begin early and include attention to math confidence, in addition to achievement.

      "Abstract Note" : "A conduction-cooled split-gap superconductingmagnet system with a center field of 8 T has been designed and fabricated in the Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The system consists of two Bi-2223/Ag coils and six NbTi coils. Due to a large aspect ratio of the high-temperature superconducting tape, there will be large ac losses when the magnet is ramped up and down. An accurate estimation of the total ac losses in the high-temperature superconducting coils is essential for the cryogenic system design. In the Bi-2223/Ag coils, the total ac losses mainly originate from two parts: One is transport loss caused by the variation of transport current with respect to time, and the other is magnetization loss due to alternating external magnetic field. In this paper, the effect of temperature variation on ac losses generated in the Bi-2223/Ag coils is studied. The magnetic field and temperature dependence relations of the critical current density J(c) are considered. The calculations are carried out in three steps. First, to estimate the magnitude of ac losses rapidly in the Bi-2223/Ag coils, the ac losses are calculated when the Bi-2223/Ag and NbTi coils are simultaneously charged, in which the temperature distribution is not considered. Second, the temperature variation is considered to calculate the ac losses under the same operating conditions with those in the first case. Finally, the NbTi coils are charged first, followed by the Bi-2223/Ag coils; the ac losses calculated are less than those in the second case. Hence, it is a good way to reduce the ac losses by changing the charging sequences of the Bi-2223/Ag and NbTi cols. Afterward, the calculated results are compared with the experimental data, and they show a good agreement.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The performance of electromagnetic calorimeter modules made of proton-irradiated PbWO4 crystals has been studied in beam tests. The modules, similar to those used in the Endcaps of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), were formed from 5x5 matrices of PbWO4 crystals, which had previously been exposed to 24 GeV protons up to integrated fluences between 2.1 x 10(13) and 1.3 x 10(14) cm(-2). These correspond to the predicted charged-hadron fluences in the ECAL Endcaps at pseudorapidity eta = 2.6 after about 500 fb(-1) and 3000 fb(-1) respectively, corresponding to the end of the LHC and High Luminosity LHC operation periods. The irradiated crystals have a lower light transmission for wavelengths corresponding to the scintillation light, and a correspondingly reduced light output. A comparison with four crystals irradiated in situ in CMS showed no significant rate dependence of hadron-induced damage. A degradation of the energy resolution and a non-linear response to electron showers are observed in damaged crystals. Direct measurements of the light output from the crystals show the amplitude decreasing and pulse becoming faster as the fluence increases. The latter is interpreted, through comparison with simulation, as a side-effect of the degradation in light transmission. The experimental results obtained can be used to estimate the long term performance of the CMS ECAL.",

A new winding switching technique is experimentally validated in this study that can extend the speed range of such PM machines. A drive topology is proposed that utilises two current regulated voltage source inverters to control the machine in a dual inverter fed configuration before transitioning into an open winding configuration after winding switching. The proposed drive topology extends the constant torque region of the machine and boosts its maximum output power capability.

      "Abstract Note" : "High-field, high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at W-(similar to 94 GHz) and D-band (similar to 140 GHz) is important for investigating the conformational dynamics of flexible biological macromolecules because this frequency range has increased spectral sensitivity to nitroxide motion over the 100 ps to 2 ns regime. However, low concentration sensitivity remains a roadblock for studying aqueous samples at high magnetic fields. Here, we examine the sensitivity of a non-resonant thin-layer cylindrical sample holder, coupled to a quasi-optical induction-mode W-band EPR spectrometer (HiPER), for continuous wave (CW) EPR analyses of: (i) the aqueous nitroxide standard, TEMPO; (ii) the unstructured to alpha-helical transition of a model IDP protein; and (iii) the base-stacking transition in a kink-turn motif of a large 232 nt RNA. For sample volumes of similar to 50 mu L, concentration sensitivities of 2-20 mu M were achieved, representing a similar to 10-fold enhancement compared to a cylindrical TE011 resonator on a commercial Bruker W-band spectrometer. These results therefore highlight the sensitivity of the thin-layer sample holders employed in HiPER for Spin-labeling studies of biological macromolecules at high fields, where applications can extend to other systems that are facilitated by the modest sample volumes and ease of sample loading and geometry.

      "Abstract Note" : "Bycatch of non-target species in commercial fisheries is a major source of anthropogenic injury and mortality for marine megafauna, including marine turtles. Their long life histories and large-scale habitat use increase the risk of interaction with multiple fleets and gear types, with consequences for population decline or collapse. However, assessment of bycatch species rarely extends beyond a single-fishery management approach, without considering the impacts of additional bycatch incurred in other fisheries. To demonstrate the need for cross-jurisdictional assessment of turtle bycatch, we evaluate the cumulative patterns of turtle bycatch in Australian commercial fisheries. We sourced logbook bycatch records from multiple fisheries in three separate management jurisdictions over the period 2000-2013. The highest bycatch per unit effort values were reported in pelagic gillnets, otter trawls and pelagic longlines. Spatial analysis revealed a bycatch 'hotspot' in the Gulf of Carpentaria, where commercial fisheries impact multiple turtle species and genetic stocks. Our results illustrate the need to set cumulative bycatch quotas for marine turtles, and to evaluate turtle bycatch at the population level instead of separately within individual fisheries. We stress the need for timely collaboration between management agencies in order to implement effective, biologically relevant management strategies for marine turtles and other vulnerable taxa.

This study examined the impact of guessing and its interactions with other test characteristics on four confidence interval (CI) procedures for coefficient alpha in terms of coverage rate (CR), length, and the degree of asymmetry of CI estimates. In addition, interval estimates of coefficient alpha when data follow the essentially tau-equivalent condition were investigated as a supplement to the case of dichotomous data with examinee guessing. For dichotomous data with guessing, the results did not reveal salient negative effects of guessing and its interactions with other test characteristics (sample size, test length, coefficient alpha levels) on CR and the degree of asymmetry, but the effect of guessing was salient as a main effect and an interaction effect with sample size on the length of the CI estimates, making longer CI estimates as guessing increases, especially when combined with a small sample size. Other important effects (e.g., CI procedures on CR) are also discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Committing financial fraud is a serious breach of business ethics. However, there are few large scale studies of financial fraud, which involve ethical considerations. In this study, we investigate the pervasive financial scandals, which by the end of 2012 involved more than a third of the US-listed Chinese companies. Based on a sample of 262 US-listed Chinese companies, we analyze factors that differentiate between firms that commit financial fraud and those that do not. We find that firms more predisposed to unethical behavior, due to their low regional social trust in the home country and low respect for regulations and laws as proxied by political connections, are more likely to commit accounting and financial fraud. They take advantage of low hurdles for listing via reverse mergers and avoid third-party monitoring through poor governance and auditors. Finally, we find evidence, after these scandals, of non-fraudulent firms differentiating themselves from the fraudulent firms by sending costly signals such as insiders purchasing shares, increasing dividends, and going private.",

In the present work, a methodology to optimize the properties of MgB2 bulk superconductors is described. The method uses the addition of an organic carbon source (stearic acid, C18H36O2), due to the homogeneous distribution of the doping material in the matrix, before final chemical reaction. The procedure was developed using high-energy ball milling to mix the precursor powders and performing heat treatment in a hot isostatic press, to improve the densification and grain connectivity. As a result, the critical current density enhanced around 600 times at 3T, when compared to the pure MgB2 samples produced using the same approach.",

The present study sought to explore whether these anxiety sensitivity classes moderated the relations between the degree of pre-quit reductions in anxiety sensitivity and the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and craving experienced on quit-day. Methods: Participants included 195 adult smokers (47% female; Mage =39.4) participating in a larger \"anxiety sensitivity reduction-smoking cessation\" intervention trial. Results: Anxiety sensitivity class significantly moderated relations between pre-quit reduction in anxiety sensitivity and quit-day craving. Specifically, smokers within the anxiety sensitivity high-risk class, who also demonstrated lesser pre-quit reductions in anxiety sensitivity, experienced the highest levels of craving on quit-day. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of 'high-risk' classes of anxiety sensitivity to better understand the experience of craving on quit day. 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Prodromal symptoms (PS), indicative of myocardial ischemia, are frequently unrecognized by individuals prior to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACSs are the leading cause of death worldwide. This study describes (1) the prevalence and association of PS with patients' baseline ACS-related acute symptoms of pain intensity and state anxiety and (2) the relationship of PS to co-morbidity. Methods: An exploratory sub-analysis was performed. Cross sectional data identified prodromal predictors of ACS pain intensity (numeric rating scale 0-10 (NRS)) and state anxiety (Speilberger state-trait anxiety personality inventory (STAI)). ACS patients (n=121) admitted to a community rural emergency department completed the prodromal symptom screening scale (PS-SS) and reported baseline cardiac pain intensity, state, and trait anxiety. Results: Increased ACS pain intensity was associated with PS. Median pain scores were higher by two points for those with prodromal headache, p=0.006, and anxiety, p=0.017, and one point higher for those with sleep disturbances, p=0.012. PS were not associated with state or trait anxiety. Hypertensive individuals were 7.5 times more likely to experience prodromal fatigue prior to their ACS event. Conclusion: Results extend current knowledge of the predictive value that prodromal headache, sleep disturbance and anxiety may have on individuals' acute symptom presentation. A prospective, prognostic study is required in order to determine whether PS are predictive of adverse cardiac events and if PS are a stronger predictor of ACS acute symptom presentation, compared with typical ACS-related co-morbidities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We have studied the influence of the oxygen partial pressure pO(2) up to 5.5 bar on the phase changes that occur during the melt processing of a state-of-the-art Bi-2212 multifilamentary wire. Phase changes have been monitored in situ by high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We found that the stability of the Bi-2212 phase is reduced with increasing pO(2). For pO(2) > 1 bar, a significant amount of the Bi-2212 phase decomposes upon heating in the range of 400 degrees C-650 degrees C. The extent of decomposition strongly increases with increasing pO(2), and at pO(2) = 5.5 bar Bi-2212 completely decomposes in the solid state. Textured Bi-2212 can be formed during solidification when pO(2) is reduced to 0.45 bar when the precursor is molten. Since the formation of current-limiting second phases is very sensitive to pO(2) when it exceeds 1 bar, we recommend to reduce the oxygen partial pressure below the commonly used pO(2) = 1 bar, in order to increase the pO(2) margins and to make the overpressure process more robust.",

Feasibility was assessed by three objectives: (1) ATT will not need extensive preparation beyond their original therapy training; (2) the study will require minimal cost; and (3) ATT must not impair the effectiveness of the exercise program. By the study conclusion, all objectives were met. Time and cost were minimal for ATT, and adherence was 93% and 90% for E+ATT and E, respectively. There were significant improvements in both groups (p <= .05) for arm curls, get-up and go, and 6-min walk.

We examined the relative effectiveness of framed messages that simultaneously promoted two different health behaviors-eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calcium supplements-for preventing osteoporosis. Because those behaviors are associated with different perceptions of risk, we predicted that gain- and loss-framed messages would have opposite effects. In two experiments, participants (N-1 = 69; N-2 = 219) were randomly assigned to a gain- or loss-framed message presenting two osteoporosis prevention behaviors. A gain-framed advantage was observed for dietary calcium consumption, but the opposite-a loss-framed advantage-was observed for use of calcium supplements. Message frame interacted with baseline calcium consumption behavior for some outcomes. Both gain- and loss-framed messages increased osteoporosis prevention behavior, but their relative effectiveness depended on the type of behavior. Framed messages can have opposite effects on different behaviors used to achieve a common health goal.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Three moorings equipped with 10 current meters and 7 CTDs were deployed in the Bashi Channel, the main deep connection between the northwestern Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea, from August 2010 to April 2011 to investigate the deepwater overflow of the North Pacific Deep Water through it. Results from these observations provide, for the first time, valuable information on the spatial structure of the deep current and allow us to estimate the overflow transport with greater accuracy. The observed current is coherent both vertically and horizontally but exhibits a much stronger velocity in the central area compared to near the edges of the channel. The core of the overflow is found near 2600 m, with mean velocity, potential temperature, and salinity of 22.5 cm s(-1), 1.79 degrees C, and 34.64 psu, respectively. The current is approximately geostrophic, with isopycnals sloping upward to the right-hand side of the flow. The local Froude number is found much less than 1, implying that the deep flow in the Bashi Channel could not be hydraulically controlled. The observations yield an 8-month mean transport of 0.78 Sv with an rms error of 0.18 Sv. The transport time series exhibits significant intraseasonal variabilities, including variability on time scale close to the resonance period of the deep channel in the Luzon Strait (similar to 30 days). Higher transports are connected with a higher velocity and a thicker overflow layer, allowing colder and saltier (thus denser) North Pacific Deep Water to flow into the South China Sea.

      "Abstract Note" : "Belle (Bel), the Drosophila homolog of the yeast DEAD-box RNA helicase DED1 and human DDX3, has been shown to be required for oogenesis and female fertility. Here we report a novel role of Bel in regulating the expression of transgenes. Abrogation of Bel by mutations or RNAi induces silencing of a variety of P-element-derived transgenes. This silencing effect depends on downregulation of their RNA levels. Our genetic studies have revealed that the RNA helicase Spindle-E (Spn-E), a nuage RNA helicase that plays a crucial role in regulating RNA processing and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis in germline cells, is required for loss-of-bel-induced transgene silencing. Conversely, Bel abrogation alleviates the nuage-protein mislocalization phenotype in spn-E mutants, suggesting a competitive relationship between these two RNA helicases. Additionally, disruption of the chromatin remodeling factor Mod(mdg4) or the microRNA biogenesis enzyme Dicer-1 (Dcr-1) also alleviates the transgene-silencing phenotypes in bel mutants, suggesting the involvement of chromatin remodeling and microRNA biogenesis in loss-of-bel-induced transgene silencing. Finally we show that genetic inhibition of Bel function leads to de novo generation of piRNAs from the transgene region inserted in the genome, suggesting a potential piRNA-dependent mechanism that may mediate transgene silencing as Bel function is inhibited.

      "Abstract Note" : "Emotions play a prominent role in social life, yet the direct impact of emotions on behavior and judgment remains a point of disagreement. The current investigation used meta-analysis to test two theoretical perspectives. The emotion-as-direct-causation perspective asserts that current emotions guide behavior and judgment, whereas the emotion-as-feedback perspective asserts that anticipated emotions guide behavior and judgment. Although the emotion-as-direct-causation perspective was frequently tested, only 22% of tests were significant. Although the emotion-as-feedback perspective was rarely tested, 87% of tests were significant. Our findings suggest that empirical evidence is weak for the default assumption that emotion is the proximal cause of behavior and judgment. Our preliminary findings also suggest that anticipated emotion reliably impacts social behavior and judgment.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Sparse grid (SG) stochastic collocation methods have been recently used to build accurate but cheap-to run surrogates for groundwater models to reduce the computational burden of Bayesian uncertainty analysis. The surrogates can be built for either a log-likelihood function or state variables such as hydraulic head and solute concentration. Using a synthetic groundwater flow model, this study evaluates the log-likelihood and head surrogates in terms of the computational cost of building them, the accuracy of the surrogates, and the accuracy of the distributions of model parameters and predictions obtained using the surrogates. The head surrogates outperform the log-likelihood surrogates for the following four reasons: (1) the shape of the head response surface is smoother than that of the log-likelihood response surface in parameter space, (2) the head variation is smaller than the log-likelihood variation in parameter space, (3) the interpolation error of the head surrogates does not accumulate to be larger than the interpolation error of the log-likelihood surrogates, and (4) the model simulations needed for building one head surrogate can be recycled for building others. For both log-likelihood and head surrogates, adaptive sparse grids are built using two indicators: absolute error and relative error. The adaptive head surrogates are insensitive to the error indicators, because the ratio between the two indicators is hydraulic head, which has small variation in the parameter space. The adaptive log-likelihood surrogates based on the relative error indicators outperform those based on the absolute error indicators, because adaptation based on the relative error indicator puts more sparse-grid nodes in the areas in the parameter space where the log-likelihood is high. While our numerical study suggests building state-variable surrogates and using the relative error indicator for building log-likelihood surrogates, selecting appropriate type of surrogates and error indicators depends on the shapes of response surfaces. The shapes should be approximated and examined before building sparse grid surrogates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this paper we compare the simulated Arctic Ocean in 15 global ocean-sea ice models in the framework of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments, phase II (CORE-II). Most of these models are the ocean and sea-ice components of the coupled climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments. We mainly focus on the hydrography of the Arctic interior, the state of Atlantic Water layer and heat and volume transports at the gateways of the Davis Strait, the Bering Strait, the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. We found that there is a large spread in temperature in the Arctic Ocean between the models, and generally large differences compared to the observed temperature at intermediate depths. Warm bias models have a strong temperature anomaly of inflow of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. Another process that is not represented accurately in the CORE-II models is the formation of cold and dense water, originating on the eastern shelves. In the cold bias models, excessive cold water forms in the Barents Sea and spreads into the Arctic Ocean through the St. Anna Through. There is a large spread in the simulated mean heat and volume transports through the Fram Strait and the Barents Sea Opening. The models agree more on the decadal variability, to a large degree dictated by the common atmospheric forcing. We conclude that the CORE-II model study helps us to understand the crucial biases in the Arctic Ocean. The current coarse resolution state-of-the-art ocean models need to be improved in accurate representation of the Atlantic Water inflow into the Arctic and density currents coming from the shelves.

      "Abstract Note" : "Corals and coral-associated species are highly vulnerable to the emerging effects of global climate change. The widespread degradation of coral reefs, which will be accelerated by climate change, jeopardizes the goods and services that tropical nations derive from reef ecosystems. However, climate change impacts to reef social-ecological systems can also be bi-directional. For example, some climate impacts, such as storms and sea level rise, can directly impact societies, with repercussions for how they interact with the environment. This study identifies the multiple impact pathways within coral reef social-ecological systems arising from four key climatic drivers: increased sea surface temperature, severe tropical storms, sea level rise and ocean acidification. We develop a novel framework for investigating climate change impacts in social-ecological systems, which helps to highlight the diverse impacts that must be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change, as well as developing appropriate management actions to mitigate climate change impacts on coral reef and people.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A reaction-diffusion model of a muscle sarcomere was developed to evaluate the sensitivity of force characteristics to diffusion and Ca2+-cycling components. The model compared well to experimental force measurements. Diffusion led to Ca2+ gradients that enhanced maximal force and accelerated relaxation compared to when diffusion was infinitely fast. However, a modest increase in sarcomere length or radius led to a decrease in maximal force. Lowering the Ca2+ release rate caused a lower maximal force, but increasing the rate led to only modest gains in maximal force while incurring much greater ATP costs associated with reuptake. Greater parvalbumin binding rates decreased maximal force but enhanced relaxation, and this effect was magnified when Ca2+ uptake rates were lowered as may occur during fatigue. These results show a physiological set of parameters that lead to a functional sarcomere of known dimensions and contractile function, and the effects of parameter variation on muscle function.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Parents experiencing racial discrimination are likely to transmit racial socialization messages to their children to protect them from future injustices. This study was conducted to better understand the role of parents' racial discrimination in their racial socialization practices for 2-parent African American families. Method: Using a sample from the Promoting Strong African American Families (N = 322 couples) program, we examined the effects of experienced discrimination on one's own and one's partner's racial socialization practices with male (n = 154) and female (n = 168) offspring. Results: Multiple-group actor-partner interdependence models showed that racial discrimination was associated with racial socialization practices. In addition, maternal experiences of discrimination had stronger relations to socialization messages relayed to daughters and greater paternal experiences of discrimination had stronger relations to socialization messages given to sons. Conclusions: This study demonstrates variability in how male and female children in African American families are socialized as a result of their parents' experiences with racial discrimination.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Via a systematic review of the literature on learning games, this article presents a systematic discussion on the design of intrinsic integration of domain-specific learning in game mechanics and game world design. A total of 69 articles ultimately met the inclusion criteria and were coded for the literature synthesis. Exemplary learning games cited in the articles reviewed and developed by credible institutions were also analyzed. The cumulative findings and propositions of the game-based learning-play integration have been extracted and synthesized into five salient themes to clarify what, how, where, and when learning and content are embedded in and activated by gameplay. These themes highlight: (a) the types of game-based learning action-prior-knowledge activation and novel-knowledge acquisition, (b) the modes in which learning actions are integrated in game actions-representation, simulation, and contextualization, (c) the blended learning spaces contrived by game mechanics and the game world, (d) the occurrence of meta-reflective and iterative learning moments during game play, and (e) the multifaceted in-game learning support (or scaffolding). Future directions for the design and research of learning integration in digital games are then proposed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low-intensity resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR resistance training) on vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood circulation. Forty healthy elderly volunteers aged 71 +/- A 4 years were divided into two training groups. Twenty subjects performed BFR resistance training (BFR group), and the remaining 20 performed ordinary resistance training without BFR. Resistance training was performed at 20 % of each estimated one-repetition maximum for 4 weeks. We measured lactate (Lac), norepinephrine (NE), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and growth hormone (GH) before and after the initial resistance training. The reactive hyperemia index (RHI), von Willebrand factor (vWF) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure in the foot (Foot-tcPO(2)) were assessed before and after the 4-week resistance training period. Lac, NE, VEGF and GH increased significantly from 8.2 +/- A 3.6 mg/dL, 619.5 +/- A 243.7 pg/mL, 43.3 +/- A 15.9 pg/mL and 0.9 +/- A 0.7 ng/mL to 49.2 +/- A 16.1 mg/dL, 960.2 +/- A 373.7 pg/mL, 61.6 +/- A 19.5 pg/mL and 3.1 +/- A 1.3 ng/mL, respectively, in the BFR group (each P < 0.01). RHI and Foot-tcPO(2) increased significantly from 1.8 +/- A 0.2 and 62.4 +/- A 5.3 mmHg to 2.1 +/- A 0.3 and 68.9 +/- A 5.8 mmHg, respectively, in the BFR group (each P < 0.01). VWF decreased significantly from 175.7 +/- A 20.3 to 156.3 +/- A 38.1 % in the BFR group (P < 0.05). BFR resistance training improved vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood circulation in healthy elderly people.",

This modification of the Newtonian potential occurs due to the existence of extra dimensions in brane world models. We will analyze a system of galaxies interacting with each other through this modified Newtonian potential. The partition function for this system of galaxies will be calculated, and this partition function will be used to calculate the free energy of this system of galaxies. The entropy and the chemical potential for this system will also be calculated. We will derive explicit expression for the clustering parameter for this system. This parameter will determine the behavior of this system, and we will be able to express various thermodynamic quantities using this clustering parameter. Thus, we will be able to explicitly analyze the effect that modifying the Newtonian potential can have on the clustering of galaxies. We also analyse the effect of extra dimensions on the two-point functions between galaxies.",

On other hand, the intellectual properties of embedded microprocessor systems are typically delivered on HDL and C source code levels. Obfuscating the code is most often the only way to protect and avoid reverse engineering. This paper presents an evaluation of operations widely used in motion estimation for an embedded microprocessor for protection purposes. A set of open source obfuscation tools has been developed that allows the use of very long and hard-to-read identifiers. The implementation of comment methods also allows for the addition of copyright and limited warranty information. The obfuscated code with identifiers of up to 2,048 characters in length is tested for Altera's and Xilinx's field programmable gate arrays for a typical HDL example. Compiler penalties as well as FFT runtime results are reported.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Ternary intermetallics, A(2)Co(12)As(7) (A=Ca, Y, Ce-Yb), have been synthesized by annealing mixtures of elements in molten Bi at 1223 K. The materials obtained crystallize in the P6(3)/m variant of the Zr2Fe12P7 structure type. The unit cell volume shows a monotonic decrease with the increasing atomic number of the rare-earth metal, with the exception of Ce-, Eu-, and Yb-containing compounds. An examination of these outliers with X-ray absorption near edge structures (XANES) spectroscopy revealed mixed valence of Ce, Eu, and Yb, with the average oxidation states of +3.20(1), +2.47(5), and +2.91(1), respectively, at room temperature. Magnetic behavior of A(2)Co(12)As(7) is generally characterized by ferromagnetic ordering of Co 3d moments at 100-140 K, followed by low-temperature ordering of rare-earth 4f moments. The 3d-4f magnetic coupling changes from antiferromagnetic for A=Pr-Sm to ferromagnetic for A=Ce and Eu-Yb. Polarized neutron scattering experiments were performed to support the postulated ferro- and ferrimagnetic ground states for Ce2Co12As7 and Nd2Co12As7, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This phase exhibits a new structure type in orthorhombic space group Pbcm, with unit cell parameters a=8.001(1) angstrom, b=11.696(2) angstrom, c=15.020(3) angstrom (Z=4; R-1=0.0234). The structure features germanium-centered neodymium clusters Ge@Nd-9 which share faces to form layers separated by zigzag chains of cobalt atoms capped by carbon. Density of states calculations confirm that this compound is metallic, and indicate that the cobalt should not have a magnetic moment. This is supported by magnetic susceptibility measurements which show a low temperature ferromagnetic ordering at T-C=50 K due to the Nd3+ ions. Magnetization field dependence studies on single crystals indicate this compound is a strong ferromagnet with large anisotropy; the Nd3+ magnetic moments align along the a-axis.

A group of 26 people met to discuss the physics of resonances in QCD. The aim of the meeting was defined by the following three key questions: What is needed to understand the physics of resonances in QCD? Where does QCD lead us to expect resonances with exotic quantum numbers? What experimental efforts are required to arrive at a coherent picture? For light mesons and baryons only those with up, down and strange quark content were considered. For heavy-light and heavy-heavy meson systems, those with charm quarks were the focus. This document summarizes the discussions by the participants, which in turn led to the coherent conclusions we present here. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "How much should people ask of their relationships? Whereas several perspectives suggest high standards should make actual outcomes feel worse by comparison and thus harm relationships, other perspectives suggest high standards should motivate people to exert the effort necessary to cultivate quality partnerships. The current 4-year longitudinal study of newlywed couples reconciled these competing perspectives by testing a prediction implicit in Finkel, Hui, Carswell, and Larson's suffocation model of marriagethat spouses' standards interact with factors reflective of their abilities to meet those standards to predict subsequent satisfaction. Among spouses who either reported less severe problems or were in marriages observed to be characterized by lower levels of destructive behavior, standards were positively associated with satisfaction over time; among spouses who reported more severe problems or were in marriages characterized by higher levels of destructive behavior, in contrast, standards were negatively associated with satisfaction over time.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To assess the psychometric properties and construct validity of the Italian translation of the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) in adolescents, we administered the inventory to 3 independent samples of Italian high school students (Ns = 609, 618, and 1,142). Cronbach's alpha values greater than .80 were observed for the TriPM scale scores in all samples. In Sample 1, overall scores on the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory correlated substantially with TriPM total scores, r = .77, p < .001. Data from Study 1 also demonstrated adequate 3-month test-retest reliabilities for the 3 TriPM subscales. In Study 2, TriPM scores significantly predicted scores on a self-report measure of delinquent behaviors, R-adjusted(2) = .25, p < .001. In Study 3, five-factor domain scores showed significant relations with TriPM scale scores consistent with results reported for adults. Consistent with a hypothesized role of fearlessness in psychopathy, adolescents at high psychopathy risk (i.e., >97th percentile on the TriPM) reported lower fear in response to emotion-eliciting movie clips than low-psychopathy participants. In addition, scores on a measure of hedonistic moral tendencies discriminated between adolescents at high as opposed to low psychopathy. Similarly, scores on the Reflective Function Questionnaire for Youths were negatively correlated with TriPM scores. As a whole, our findings provide further support for the reliability and validity of the TriPM and its cross-cultural utility, and provide initial evidence of its effectiveness with community-dwelling adolescents.",

In this article, we outline the characteristics of eusociality, particularly the self-sacrificial behavior seen among other eusocial species (e.g., insects, shrimp, mole rats). We then discuss parallels between eusocial self-sacrificial behavior in nonhumans and suicide in humans, particularly with regard to overarousal states, withdrawal phenomena, and perceptions of burdensomeness. In so doing, we make the argument that death by suicide among humans is an exemplar of psychopathology and is due to a derangement of the self-sacrificial behavioral suite found among eusocial species. Implications and future directions for research are also presented.",

Results indicate that vocabulary accounted for greater between-grade differences and unique variance (Delta R (2) = .11-.31) in comprehension as compared to spelling (Delta R (2) = .01-.09). However, the contribution of spelling to comprehension was higher in the upper grade levels included in this cross-sectional analysis and functioned as a mediator of the impact of vocabulary knowledge at all levels. The direct effect of vocabulary was strong but lower in magnitude at each successive grade level from .58 in grade 6 to .41 in grade 10 while the indirect effect through spelling increased in magnitude at each successive grade level from .09 in grade 6 to .16 in grade 10. There were no significant differences between the language groups in the magnitude of the indirect impact, suggesting both groups of students relied more on both sources of lexical information in higher grades as compared to students in lower grades.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The lexical restructuring model (LRM) is a theory that attempts to explain the developmental origins of phonological awareness (PA). According to the LRM, various characteristics of words should be related to the extent to which words are segmentally represented in the lexicon. Segmental representations of words allow children to access the parts of words needed to complete PA tasks. This study examined the relations between various lexical characteristics of Spanish and English words and the PA skills of Spanish-speaking language-minority children. Participants came from two independent samples of Spanish-speaking preschool children (Sample 1 N = 553, Sample 2 N = 600). For children in both samples, only phonotactic probability was related to children's likelihood to respond correctly to Spanish PA items. Age of acquisition and word frequency were related to children's likelihood to respond correctly to English PA items for children in both samples. Phonological neighborhood density and phonotactic probability were also related to children's likelihood to respond correctly to English PA items; however, these effects were sample-specific. Children's Spanish vocabulary knowledge moderated the effects of Spanish age of acquisition and word frequency on responses to Spanish PA items. Children's English vocabulary knowledge moderated the effects of English phonological neighborhood density and phonotactic probability on responses to English PA items. These findings have implications for the development of PA assessments to be used with language-minority children.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Previewing answer-choice options before finishing reading the text is a widely employed test-taking behavior. In the present study we examined whether previewing is related to item response accuracy and response time, using data from Chinese learners of varying English proficiency levels and English native speakers. We examined eye movement patterns of participants who completed online multiple-choice sentence completion tasks, and how previewing was related to reading performance and whether the relation varied as a function of English proficiency level. The results showed that, relative to no previewing, previewing was associated with a significantly lower probability of answering an item correctly but not with significantly longer response time. Importantly, these relations varied across English proficiency levels such that participants with higher proficiency performed better without previewing, but there was no difference for lower-intermediate learners of English. These findings suggest that previewing does not facilitate performance on a sentence comprehension task, but instead interferes with the comprehension process, particularly for individuals with relatively high language proficiency.",

In so doing, we argue that sociologists may respond to increasing critiques of representative data by using these critiques to facilitate critical thinking skills and methodological awareness among students. In closing, we encourage sociologists to consider the challenges and opportunities presented by increasing awareness of unrepresented populations within our classrooms and the broader social world.",

However, limited attention is given to women's responses to their devaluation, particularly collective efforts to either resist or accommodate dominant beliefs about ageing women. We examine membership in the Red Hat Society, an international organisation for middle-aged and older women, as a response to gendered ageism. Drawing on data from semi-structured interviews with members (N = 52), our analysis focuses on the group's performance of girlhood', which involves adopting children's social roles, dressing up and playing. We examine its resonance with a dominant cultural metaphor for old age as second childhood', illustrating how it not only provides opportunities for resistance to gendered ageism but also contributes to its entrenchment. The behaviours constitute a performative act that resists gendered ageism by increasing ageing women's visibility and asserting their right to leisure. However, its accommodative features reproduce inequality by valuing youth over old age and depicting older women as girls engaging in frivolous activities, which can be seen as obstructing social change.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study molecular structure and dynamics because of the rich chemical information it can extract. However, low inherent sensitivity is the Achilles' heel of NMR. The use of high temperature superconducting (HTS) resonators as pick-up coils in NMR probes can significantly improve the detection sensitivity of NMR and expand the use of NMR for dilute and mass-limited samples. In previously proposed HTS-based probes, the resonators for the various channels are nested orthogonally around the sample region. With this configuration, optimal sensitivity can be achieved only by the single innermost channel, which has its coils closest to the sample. We report here a new configuration in which the NMR probe has been simultaneously optimized for detection sensitivity of two channels, namely, hydrogen and carbon. The probe employs novel double-tuned HTS resonators that generate strong, uniform, and mutually orthogonal magnetic fields at the hydrogen and carbon NMR frequencies. The resonator is designed for optimal magnetic field homogeneity and minimal electric field in the sample region. Design considerations for the resonators and probe performance in NMR tests are presented.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Previous studies have shown that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate poorer driving performance than their peers and are less likely to obtain a driver's license. This study aims to examine the relationship between driving performance and executive functioning for novice drivers, with and without ASD, using a driving simulator. Forty-four males (ages 15-23), 17 with ASD and 27 healthy controls, completed paradigms assessing driving skills and executive functioning. ASD drivers demonstrated poorer driving performance overall and the addition of a working memory task resulted in a significant decrement in their performance relative to control drivers. Results suggest that working memory may be a key mechanism underlying difficulties demonstrated by ASD drivers and provides insight for future intervention programs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Leaders who can accumulate audience costs can send costly signals that may help alleviate information problems associated with crisis escalation. We argue that research examining the effect of audience costs fails to appreciate the theoretical context in which audience costs matter. Audience costs may help alleviate information problems associated with international conflict. However, credible commitment problems are more central than information problems for some international conflicts. Theory does not expect audience costs to matter in this context; as a result, extant tests, and many criticisms, of the effect of audience costs on crisis escalation are flawed. We offer a more appropriate test of the effect of audience costs on crisis escalation. Consistent with extant theoretical arguments, we find that audience costs only reduce the likelihood of conflict when credible commitment problems are not the dominant concern motivating a dispute or crisis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Homogeneous glasses in the ternary system Ag2Se-Ga2Se3-GeSe2 are synthesized and their structure is characterized using Raman and one- and two-dimensional Se-77, Ga-71 and Ga-69 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure of these glasses consists predominantly of a charge-compensated network of corner-sharing (Ga/Ge)Se-4/2 tetrahedra where the negatively charged GaSe4/2 tetrahedra are charge balanced by the Ag cations. The deficiency in Se required to satisfy the tetrahedral coordination of Ga in glasses with Ag2Se:Ga2Se3 < 1 is accommodated by the formation of homopolar Ge-Ge bonds. Progressive addition of Ag2Se to these glasses efficiently removes Ge-Ge bonding such that their concentration essentially goes to zero at the chemical threshold Ag2Se:Ga2Se3 = 1. Further addition of Ag2Se beyond this threshold (i.e., Ag2Se:Ga2Se3 > 1) results in the modification of the Ga,Ge-Se tetrahedral network via depolymerization and formation of non-bridging Se atoms. Moreover, all glasses irrespective of their Ag2Se:Ga2Se3 ratio contain a small fraction of Se-Se bonds, implying violation of chemical order. Therefore, the compositional evolution of the structure of these glasses displays the characteristics of both the isoelectronic alkali/alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses and the purely covalent, continuously alloyed chalcogenide networks. Such composition-dependent structural evolution is shown to be consistent with the corresponding variation in glass transition temperature and molar volume. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives We examined population-based trends in unmet need for therapy service in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to other children with special health care needs (CSHCN), and identified factors associated with unmet need for therapy. Methods A pooled cross-sectional comparison of the 2005-2006 and 2009-2010 waves of the National Survey for Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) was used. Weighted bivariate analyses were used to compare children ages 3-17 years with ASD (n = 5113) to other CSHCN (n = 71,294) on unmet need for therapy services. Survey weighted multivariate models were used to examine child, family, and contextual characteristics associated with unmet need. Results A greater percentage of children with ASD across both surveys were reported to need therapy than other children with CSHCN. Among children with a reported need, children with ASD were 1.4 times more likely to report an unmet need for therapy compared to other CSHCN (OR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.18-1.71). Variables significantly associated with unmet need for therapy services included not receiving a well-child visit in the past year (OR 5.81, CI 3.83-8.81), surveyed in 2009 (OR 1.42, CI 1.18-1.71), child being female (OR 1.27, CI 1.05-1.53), uninsured (OR 1.72, CI 1.15-2.56), and having greater functional limitation (OR 2.44, CI 1.80-3.34). Conclusions for Practice Children with ASD require supportive services such as occupational, physical, and speech therapy but are less likely to receive such services than other CSHCN. Receiving a well-child visit in the past year was strongly associated with receipt of needed therapy services.",

      "Abstract Note" : "High temperature superconducting (HTS) conductor-on-round-core (CORC (R)) cables have been developed for use in power transmission systems and large high-field magnets. The use of high-current conductors for large-scale magnets reduces system inductance and limits the peak voltage needed for ramped field operation. A CORC (R) cable contains a large number of RE-Ba2Cu3O7-delta (RE - rare earth) (REBCO) coated conductors, helically wound in multiple layers on a thin, round former. Large-scale applications, such as fusion and accelerator magnets, require current ramp rates of several kilo-Amperes per second during pulsed operation. This paper presents results that demonstrate the electromagnetic stability of a CORC (R) cable during transient conditions. Measurements were performed at 4.2 K using a 1.55 m long CORC (R) cable in background fields of up to 19 T. Repeated current pulses in a background field of 19 T at current ramp rates of up to 67.8 kA s(-1) to approximately 90% of the cable's quench current at that field, did not show any sign of degradation in cable performance due to excessive ac loss or electromagnetic instability. The very high current ramp rates applied during these tests were used to compensate, to the extent possible, the limited cable length accommodated by the test facility, assuming that the measured results could be extrapolated to longer length cables operated at proportionally lower current ramp rates. No shift of the superconducting transition to lower current was measured when the current ramp rate was increased from 25 A s(-1) to 67.8 kA s(-1). These results demonstrate the viability of CORC (R) cables for use in low-inductance magnets that operate at moderate to high current ramp rates.",

With the multi-width (MW) no-insulation (NI) high temperature superconductor (HTS) winding technique incorporated, the magnet is highly compact; its overall diameter and height are 172 and 327 mm, respectively. It consists of a stack of 26 NI double pancake coils wound with MW GdBCO tapes in five different widths ranged 4.1-8.1 mm. In a bath of liquid nitrogen at 77 K, the magnet had a charging time constant of 16 min due to the intrinsic NI characteristics. In liquid helium at 4.2 K, the magnet generated a 26.4 T field at the center, a record high in magnetic fields from all-HTS magnets. The results demonstrate a strong potential of MW-NI GdBCO magnets for direct current high-field applications.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The problem of identifying the diffusion parameter appearing in a nonlocal steady diffusion equation is considered. The identification problem is formulated as an optimal control problem having a matching functional as the objective of the control and the parameter function as the control variable. The analysis makes use of a nonlocal vector calculus that allows one to define a variational formulation of the nonlocal problem. In a manner analogous to the local partial differential equations counterpart, we demonstrate, for certain kernel functions, the existence of at least one optimal solution in the space of admissible parameters. We introduce a Galerkin finite element discretization of the optimal control problem and derive a priori error estimates for the approximate state and control variables. Using one-dimensional numerical experiments, we illustrate the theoretical results and show that by using nonlocal models it is possible to estimate non-smooth and discontinuous diffusion parameters.",

Given that a systematic understanding of reentry has the potential to inform research and policy efforts to assist women with transition, this gap is limiting. Our study addresses this void by testing whether social support affects reentry concerns (family, employment, financial, and stigma) among incarcerated women. Results indicate that visits reduced all concerns; receiving letters had a less consistent effect, but they too, were associated with reduced worry. In addition, experiencing multiple types of support influenced reentry concerns among women. Research and policy implications are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Delineating the factors that affect behavioral and neurological responses to alcohol is critical to facilitate measures for preventing or treating alcohol abuse. The high degree of conserved molecular and physiological processes makes Drosophila melanogaster a valuable model for investigating circadian interactions with alcohol-induced behaviors and examining sex-specific differences in alcohol sensitivity. We found that wild-type Drosophila exhibited rhythms in alcohol-induced sedation under light-dark and constant dark conditions with considerably greater alcohol exposure necessary to induce sedation during the late (subjective) day and peak sensitivity to alcohol occurring during the late (subjective) night. The circadian clock also modulated the recovery from alcohol-induced sedation with flies regaining motor control significantly faster during the late (subjective) day. As predicted, the circadian rhythms in sedation and recovery were absent in flies with a mutation in the circadian gene period or arrhythmic flies housed in constant light conditions. Flies lacking a functional circadian clock were more sensitive to the effects of alcohol with significantly longer recovery times. Similar to other animals and humans, Drosophila exhibit sex-specific differences in alcohol sensitivity. We investigated whether the circadian clock modulated the rhythms in the loss-of-righting reflex, alcohol-induced sedation, and recovery differently in males and females. We found that both sexes demonstrated circadian rhythms in the loss-of-righting reflex and sedation with the differences in alcohol sensitivity between males and females most pronounced during the late subjective day. Recovery of motor reflexes following alcohol sedation also exhibited circadian modulation in male and female flies, although the circadian clock did not modulate the difference in recovery times between the sexes. These studies provide a framework outlining how the circadian clock modulates alcohol-induced behaviors in Drosophila and identifies sexual dimorphisms in the circadian modulation of alcohol behaviors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Over the past decade, researchers have shown increased interest in examining the cognitive development of children in non-Western countries, often in connection with evaluations of health and educational interventions. However, many studies have used Western-developed measures without proper consideration of contextual validity. Across domains-from language to cognition to non-cognitive skills-this results in varying degrees of bias that call into question the findings of these studies. In this article, we focus in particular on the problem of differences in dimensionality perception between children in sub-Saharan Africa and those in Western countries. Although most Western children are exposed to extensive two-dimensional materials during early childhood, such as picture books and photographs, most rural African children are not. We therefore argue that assessments using two-dimensional stimuli, such as line drawings or patterns, may be inappropriate for capturing cognitive development in settings where such formats are unfamiliar to young children. We also discuss a modified assessment of non-verbal reasoning designed to be contextually appropriate for children in rural Africa-the Object-based Pattern Reasoning Assessment (OPRA). Created during a national study of preschool child development in Zambia, this new assessment uses local materials such as beans and stones, requires little training to administer, and avoids potential instrument bias related to two-dimensionality among young children living in developing countries.",

However, empirical research investigating how preservice teachers interact with transformative content representation, facilitation, and learning activities in a VR educational simulation is still limited. The purpose of this study is to examine prospective teachers' user experiences in a VR-based learning environment, thus exploring VR-based instructional strategies and providing potential heuristics that assist teachers to integrate VR learning environments into their future teaching practices. Five preservice teachers participated in the study. An OpenSim-supported virtual simulation of a sushi restaurant was designed to enable preservice math teachers to experience 3D simulation-based math teaching and learning. All of the data in this study were collected via video archives, interview, and infield observation. The study results indicated the importance of transformative content representation in a VR educational simulation. The results also informed on the salient heuristics of VR-based learning facilitation and learning activity design.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Concern over the potential impacts of increased temperature on marine turtles, which have temperature dependent sex determination, has resulted in an increase in research that predicts the sex ratio of marine turtle hatchlings under various scenarios of climate change. To accurately understand the projected impacts from global warming, it is necessary to understand the sex ratio baseline in advance of climate change. To address this, the primary sex ratio of loggerhead hatchlings, Caretta caretta, was estimated from incubation duration of 27,697 in situ nests from 21 nesting beaches used by two subpopulations of loggerhead turtles in Brazil over the last 25 years. A strong female bias (94%) was observed in all the areas used by the northern loggerhead stock, Sergipe (SE) and Bahia (BA), whereas a more balanced sex ratio (53% female) was estimated at the regions used by the southern loggerhead stock, Espirito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ). Both inter-annual (SE: 83% to 99%, BA: 79. % to 98%, ES: 33% to 81%, RJ: 18% to 81%) and inter-beach variabilities (SE: 91% to 98%, BA: 89% to 96%, ES: 47% to 69%, RJ: 28% to 55%) in mean female offspring were observed. These findings provide evidence of persistent female bias in Brazil, and importantly identify male producing beaches and months, which will guide management decisions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study addressed this gap using an adapted version of the ABC-X model and Family Stress Theory. The family functioning of 73 transgender parents (72.2 % born male, 25.0 % born female, and 2.8 % other, e.g., intersex), who transitioned after they had children, was examined in regard to the potential stresses associated with PGT (impact of disclosure, stigma, and boundary ambiguity), resources available to transitioning parents (social support and coping), and perception (sense of coherence and perceptions of PGT). Hierarchical multiple regression and path analysis were then conducted to determine if resources and perception altered the relationship between stress and family functioning. Findings from these transgender parents indicated an ameliorating role of sense of coherence, or the perception that they can handle the situation, on the relationship between stigma and family functioning, but not between boundary ambiguity, or confusion regarding who is in the family system, and family functioning. This suggests one avenue for professionals to intervene and help families through PGT. However, it also indicates the need for further research to determine ways to mitigate the impact of boundary ambiguity on family functioning.",

Positive bias was related to aggression beyond the effects of social preference. Positive bias was not related to depressive symptoms.

Less research, however, has used genetically sensitive research designs to control for genetic confounding and examine whether the well-supported association between bullying victimization and maladaptive development is partially accounted for by common genetic and environmental influences. Using sibling data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, the current study used a series of bivariate liability-threshold models to disentangle the genetic and environmental influences on observed covariance between repeated bullying victimization, delinquent involvement, and symptoms of depression/anxiety. Results revealed that common additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects accounted for the covariance in liability between bullying victimization and delinquent involvement as well as bullying victimization and symptoms of depression/anxiety. The results suggest the presence of genotype-environment correlation (rGE) between repeated victimization and maladaptive development.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The rates of illicit drug use among African American women are increasing, yet African American women are least likely to participate in treatment for substance use disorders when compared to women of other racial groups. The current study examined family history of substance use, perceived family support, and John Henryism Active Coping (JHAC) as correlates to seeking treatment for substance abuse. The underlying theoretical frame of JHAC (James et al.,1983) suggests that despite limited resources and psychosocial stressors, African Americans believe that hard work and self-determination are necessary to cope with adversities. The current study is a secondary data analyses of 206 drug-using African American women (N = 104 urban community women with no criminal justice involvement and N = 102 women living in the community on supervised probation) from urban cities in a southern state. It was expected that African American women with a family history of substance abuse, higher levels of perceived family support, and more active coping skills would be more likely to have participated in substance abuse treatment. Step-wise logistic regression results reveal that women on probation, had children, and had a family history of substance abuse were significantly more likely to report participating in substance abuse treatment. Perceived family support and active coping were significant negative correlates of participating in treatment. Implication of results suggests coping with psychosocial stressors using a self-determined and persistent coping strategy may be problematic for drug-using women with limited resources.

      "Abstract Note" : "The proliferation of streetcar projects in US cities is one of the most significant transportation developments of recent years, yet little is known about the factors that contribute to streetcar ridership or whether these factors differ from those related to light rail transit use. This study uses multivariate models to examine differences in the factors related to average weekday station boardings on a set of US streetcar and light rail systems. While there are some similarities with respect to population levels and proximity to special generators for ridership on each mode, the results also point to important differences in the role that service characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and land use factors have on station-level ridership. The set of factors associated with light rail boardings suggest light rail's use by a more utilitarian rider market, while those factors associated with modern streetcars suggest greater use by individuals trying to reach tourism and special activity centre-related destinations. These findings suggest that the modes are not substitutes for one another and that cities should carefully consider the decision to select one mode or the other for implementation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Young children's executive function (EF) is increasingly recognized as an important construct associated with development in cognitive and socioemotional domains. To date, however, few studies have examined EF in populations of language-minority children. In this study, 241 Spanish-speaking language-minority preschoolers who ranged in age from 38 to 69 months (M = 54.23 months, SD = 6.17) completed three tasks designed to measure inhibitory control (IC) and four tasks designed to measure working memory (WM). Children completed assessments of their vocabulary skills, early literacy skills, and behavioral self-regulation in both English and Spanish, and their classroom teachers completed three behavior rating measures. Children were classified as more proficient in English or Spanish based on their scores on the vocabulary measures, and all IC and WM measures were administered in the children's more proficient language. Results of confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor model of EF for both groups of children as well as strong measurement and structural invariance across groups. Children's EF was substantially related to the language, early literacy, and behavioral self-regulation measures as well as teacher ratings of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For children with more proficient English, EF was associated with skills in both English and Spanish; however, for children with more proficient Spanish, EF was associated primarily with skills in Spanish. These results provide evidence of strong correspondence for EF measured in Spanish-speaking language-minority preschoolers and monolingual preschoolers, and they identify a potential key factor that can enhance understanding of development in this population of children.

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite the importance of phonological awareness for the development of reading in alphabetic languages, little attention has been paid to its developmental origins. In this study, dual-process, latent growth models were used to examine patterns of bidirectional relations between letter knowledge and phonological awareness during preschool. The sample comprised 358 children (mean age = 48.60 months, SD = 7.26). Growth models were used to quantify the unique longitudinal relations between the initial level of each skill and growth in the other skill during the preschool year, after controlling for initial level of the same skill, vocabulary, age, and growth in the code-related skill being used as a predictor. Letter-name knowledge and phonological awareness were bidirectionally related; the initial level of each uniquely predicted growth in the other. Initial letter-sound knowledge and phonological awareness growth were not uniquely related, and vocabulary was not related to growth in phonological awareness. These findings extend the evidence of the relation between letter knowledge and phonological awareness to supra-phonemic tasks, indicating that this bidirectional relation begins at an earlier point in the development of phonological awareness than previously reported. In addition, these findings help to rule out general growth in letter knowledge and phonological awareness as an alternative explanation for the bidirectional relation between these two code-related skills.

      "Abstract Note" : "It is well known that calculations of the entries of the stiffness matrix in the finite element approximations of nonlocal diffusion and mechanics models are often very time-consuming due to the double integration process over the domain and the singularities of the nonlocal kernel functions. In this paper, we propose some effective and accurate quadrature rules for computing these double integrals for one-dimensional nonlocal problems; in particular, for problems with highly singular kernels, the corresponding inner integrals can be first evaluated exactly in our method, and the outer one then will be approximated by some popular quadrature rules. With these quadrature rules, the assembly of the stiffness matrix in the finite element method for the nonlocal problems becomes similar to that for the classical partial differential equations and is thus quite efficient.

In order to address this gap in the literature, this study examines the potential association between nonshared environments and measures of intelligence (recall ability) in adulthood using monozygotic (MZ) difference scores analyses. Analysis of MZ twin pairs drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health revealed that none of the nonshared environmental variables were consistently related to recall ability. One nonshared environmental variable, maternal disengagement, was found to be a significant predictor of recall ability in two of the four recall tasks. In addition, measures of maternal attachment and delinquent peers were found to be associated with only one test of word recall ability and none of the three other recall tests.

Altruism has significant effects on common bond and identity whereas altruism has a greater effect on common bond than common identity.

      "Abstract Note" : "Power electronic-based components (PECs) are at the heart of the enabling technologies for the smart-grids. They improve the controllability of the power system and provide excellent features such as load regulation, high power factor, and transient performance. However, they can behave as negative impedance due to their capability to operate as constant power loads, and jeopardize the stability of the power systems. Therefore, stability analysis of the power electronic-based distribution systems is crucial for development of the future smart-grids. This paper provides two methods to analyze stability: real-time (online) and offline. In real-time approach, the system's small-signal stability is investigated based on d - q impedance measurement and unit circle criterion and by calculating source and load impedances simultaneously and in a range of frequencies. In offline approach, the system dynamics are identified from the bode plots and then based on the eigenvalue analysis, the stability of the system under different loading conditions is analyzed. Furthermore, small-signal stability of a solid state transformer (SST) as an advanced PEC with power factor correction is investigated via the proposed methods. In addition, hardware experiment is developed though power hardware-in-the-loop experiment to assess stability of an SST in load variation and validate the real-time capability of the proposed technique.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Cu-2wt% Fe alloy, an inexpensive candidate for a high strength conductor, depends for its conductivity on the precipitation of Fe. We applied an external 12 T high magnetic field (HMF) during ageing treatment of this alloy in order to study the resulting gamma-Fe precipitation on the electrical conductivity. When the alloy was aged at 450 degrees C for up to 16 h, coherent gamma-Fe precipitates formed within the Cu matrix. Between the gamma-Fe precipitates and the Cu matrix, the lattice misfit was 1.4% +/- 0.7% and the angle between closed packed planes was about 0.3 degrees. These gamma-Fe precipitates became semi-coherent with the surrounding Cu matrix in samples aged at 700 degrees C for over 0.5 h. HMF made insignificant contributions to both the morphology and the volume fraction of gamma-Fe at 450 degrees C. At 700 degrees C, however, HMF promoted a transformation from coherent to semi-coherent gamma-Fe precipitates. Applying HMF during ageing at 700 degrees C increased electrical conductivity. HMF had little influence on the nucleation of gamma-Fe precipitation. We applied the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) formula to the coarsening data of the precipitates and determined that HMF increased the diffusion coefficient of Fe in Cu and promoted the growth of gamma-Fe precipitation out of the Cu matrix.

Three flexible PU foams with similar morphology were selected for the study. First the commonalities as well as the differences between these foams in terms of their chemical composition, microstructure and thermomechanical properties were thoroughly analyzed. This is followed by the auxetic convertibility study of these three foams. Mechanisms for fixing the structure were elucidated and the windows for processing were interpreted in the context of polymer relaxation. Guided by these understandings, a series of auxetic foams were manufactured at a wide range of conditions. The processing conditions agreed very well with those suggested from the mechanistic investigation, validating the proposed auxetic conversion and structure fixation mechanisms. The mechanism was further confirmed by direct observation of the morphology of the fabricated auxetic foams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Fluorescence spectra of all-trans-1,6-dipheny1-1,3,5-hexatriene were measured in n-hexadecane at 99 degrees C by varying lambda(exc) in the 294-404 nm range. Resolution of this spectral matrix into s-trans,s-trans and s-cis,s-trans conformer fluorescence spectra yields the lambda(exc) dependence of fractional contributions which are converted to conformer specific fluorescence excitation spectra. Conformer absorption spectra obtained from the fluorescence excitation spectra are remarkably similar, but differ significantly from absorption spectra derived from a spectrothermal absorption spectral matrix measured in n-alkanes under isopolarizability conditions. The results reveal substantial conformer equilibration in the excited state. Theory is consistent with adiabatic conformer equilibration in the 2(1)Ag state. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "To determine effects of photochemical weathering of petroleum, surrogate and Macondo (MC252) crude oils were exposed to solar radiation during the formation of Water Accommodated Fractions (WAFs) in sterile seawater. Samples were incubated in either unfiltered sunlight, with ultraviolet radiation blocked (Photosynthetically Active Radiation [PAR] only), or in darkness. WAFs were collected at two time points over the course of a week. Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analyses of water soluble species formed during exposure to sunlight were compared for the different treatments. Photochemical alterations resulted in differences in compound class distributions. In general, surrogate oil was photo-oxidized across a wider carbon number range compared to MC252. While photochemical differences were observed between MC252 and surrogate oils, microbial production in seawater responded similarly to both WAFs from both types of oils with the majority of the inhibition resulting from oil exposure to visible light.

      "Abstract Note" : "The silicate and metal clasts in CB chondrites have been inferred to form as condensates from an impact-generated vapor plume between a metal-rich body and a silicate body. A detailed study of the condensation of impact-generated vapor plumes showed that the range of CB silicate clast compositions could not be successfully explained without invoking a chemically differentiated target. Here, we report the most comprehensive elemental study yet performed on CB silicates with 32 silicate clasts from nine slices of Gujba analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for 53 elements. Like in other studies of CBs, the silicate clasts are either barred olivine (BO) or cryptocrystalline (CC) in texture. In major elements, the Gujba silicate clasts ranged from chondritic to refractory enriched. Refractory element abundances ranged from 2 to 10 x CI, with notable anomalies in Ba, Ce, Eu, and U abundances. The two most refractory-enriched BO clasts exhibited negative Ce anomalies and were depleted in U relative to Th, characteristic of volatilization residues, while other BO clasts and the CC clasts exhibited positive Ce anomalies with excess U (1-3 x CI), and Ba (1-6 x CI) anomalies indicating recondensation of ultra-refractory element depleted vapor. The Rare Earth Elements (REE) also exhibit light REE (LREE) enrichment or depletion in several clasts with a range of (La/Sm)(CI) of 0.9-1.8. This variation in the LREE is essentially impossible to accomplish by processes involving vapor-liquid or vapor-solid exchange of REE, and appears to have been inherited from a differentiated target. The most distinctive evidence for inherited chemical differentiation is observed in highly refractory element (Sc, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, Th) systematics. The Gujba clasts exhibit fractionations in Nb/Ta that correlate positively with Zr/Hf and span the range known from lunar and Martian basalts, and exceed the range in Zr/Hf variation known from eucrites. Variations of highly incompatible refractory elements (e.g., Th) against less incompatible elements (e.g., Zr, Sr, Sc) are not chondritic, but exhibit distinctly higher Th abundances requiring a differentiated crust to be admixed with depleted mantle in ratios that are biased to higher crust/mantle ratios than in a chondritic body. The possibility that these variations are due to admixture of refractory inclusion-debris into normal chondritic matter is raised but cannot be definitively tested because existing \"bulk\" analyses of CAIs carry artifacts of unrepresentative sampling. The inferences drawn from the compositions of Gujba silicate clasts, here, complement what has been inferred from the compositions of metallic clasts, but provide surprisingly detailed insight into the structure of the target. Evidence that metal and silicate in CB chondrites both formed from impact-generated vapor plumes, taken together with recent work on metallic nodules in E chondrites, and on ordinary chondrites, indicates that chondrule formation occurs by this mechanism quite widely. However, the nature of the impact on the CB body is quite different than the popular conceptions of impact of partially or wholly molten chondritic bodies and the younger (5 Ma) age of CB chondrules is consistent with origin in a disk with more evolved targets and impactors gravitationally perturbed by nascent planets.

Drawing on 52 in-depth interviews with members of the Red Hat Society, we show that women draw on their political generation, and the gains of the women's movement specifically, to oppose cultural constructions of aging. The Red Hat Society provides a free space for women to foster a collective identity that both visibly challenges aging norms and provides its members new standards for self-approval. We conclude by highlighting the importance of focusing on political generation to understand collective action over the life course and call for more scholarship on the function of political generation in social change.",

This study uses implementation of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program to examine the use of formal and informal contract management techniques in the implementation of energy projects. The use of formal contract mechanisms, such as full and open competitive bidding, contact rescission and outcome-based performance measures, exhibits a statistically significant effect on implementation performance. The findings advance contracting theory and have practical implications for local government contracting and implementation success in fiscal federalism.",

Participants completed a measure of the five major dimensions of personality and reported on their physical activity, diet and food intake behaviour, and height and weight.Main Outcome Measures: BMI and obesity (BMI30).Results: High Neuroticism was associated with higher BMI and risk for obesity, whereas Conscientiousness and, to a lesser extent, Extraversion and Openness were protective. These associations were generally stronger among women and older participants; there was less evidence for ethnicity as a moderator. Personality had similar relations with the behavioural factors, and physical activity, diet and regular meal rhythms accounted for approximately 50% of the association between Neuroticism and Conscientiousness and BMI.Conclusion: This study supports the links between personality traits and BMI and suggests that physical activity, more than diet, is a key factor in these associations.",

This study examined within a Greek-speaking nonclinical sample (N = 419) associations between differing phenotypic dimensions of psychopathy (boldness, meanness, disinhibition) assessed via the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) and self-report criterion measures of psychopathology, personality, and history of abuse and neglect. Consistent with predictions of the triarchic model of psychopathy, evidence was found for distinct correlates of the 3 phenotypic dimensions. Boldness was associated with both adaptive (immunity to anxiety/distress, fearlessness, low hostility) and maladaptive tendencies (grandiose manipulative traits, Machiavellian features including desire for control/status, and verbal aggression). Meanness was related to callous and unemotional traits, features of Machiavellianism (e.g., amoral manipulation and distrust of others), physical aggression, and absence of positive parenting. Disinhibition, by contrast, was characterized by anxiety and distress, exposure to violence, and retrospective accounts of abuse history, along with impulsive, irresponsible, and hostile tendencies. These findings indicate that the Greek-Cypriot translation of the TriPM effectively assesses the constructs of the triarchic model and extend what we know about their empirical correlates.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent studies start to explore the potential benefits of directly assimilating the radiance from the infrared imagers onboard geostationary satellites to the short-range numerical weather prediction both on the synoptic- and meso-scales, where accurate quantification of the bias and observation error arising from the numerical model and the instrument is a key component in such experiments. This paper investigates both the bias and the observation errors of the Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR) onboard Chinese operational geostationary satellite Fengyun-2F, as the first step towards its clear-sky radiance assimilation. In this study, 774,530 observations that passed a five-step quality control procedure during the period of 1-7 July in 2014 are collected to investigate the mentioned two quantities while the synthetic simulated clear radiance is calculated through a numerical weather prediction model and a radiative transfer model. Persistent warm biases are found for FY-2F S-VISSR channel 3, 4 and 5 during day and night, and they are possibly due to the uncertainty from the instrument calibration process. The observation errors of S-VISSR infrared channels vary with the surface types, generally with larger values over land than over ocean, which could partially be explained by the variation of the land types over land. Besides, whether these biases change with viewing geometry or evolve with time is also examined in our study. Biases from the three surface channels exhibit complex dependence on the scan position and evolve with time, which encourages incorporating both the scan position and temporal corrections into the S-VISSR bias correction scheme in the data assimilation system.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest in US history, unprecedented for the depth and volume of oil released, the amount of dispersants applied, and the unexpected, protracted sedimentation of oil-associated marine snow (MOS) to the seafloor. Marine snow formation, incorporation of oil, and subsequent gravitational settling to the seafloor (i.e., MOSSFA: Marine Oil Snow Sedimentation and Flocculent Accumulation) was a significant pathway for the distribution and fate of oil, accounting for as much as 14% of the total oil released. Long residence times of oil on the seafloor will result in prolonged exposure by benthic organisms and economically important fish. Bioaccumulation of hydrocarbons into the food web also has been documented. Major surface processes governing the MOSSFA event included an elevated and extended Mississippi River discharge, which enhanced phytoplankton production and suspended particle concentrations, zooplankton grazing, and enhanced microbial mucus formation. Previous reports indicated that MOS sedimentation also occurred during the Tsesis and Ixtoc-I oil spills; thus, MOSSFA events may occur during future oil spills, particularly since 85% of global deep-water oil exploration sites are adjacent to deltaic systems. We provide a conceptual framework of MOSSFA processes and identify data gaps to help guide current research and to improve our ability to predict MOSSFA events under different environmental conditions. Baseline time-series data and model development are urgently needed for all levels of ecosystems in regions of hydrocarbon extraction to prepare for and respond to future oil spills and to understand the impacts of oil spills on the environment.

      "Abstract Note" : "The present research leverages the \"irrational options\" theoretical framework to explore options rationality differences between salespeople and non-salespeople. Specifically, the reported research first examines (Study 1) whether or not salespeople are more likely to place a higher value on diminishing options than individuals who do not work in sales. Two follow-up studies embed a potential internal moderator (salesperson thinking style; Study 2) and a potential external moderator (performance-based incentives; Study 3) of salesperson valuations of diminishing options. The method employed in all three studies is an experimental design tailored after Shin and Ariely's (Management Science 50(5):575-586, 2004) seminal work on irrationality and options availability. The results demonstrate that, compared to non-salespeople, salespeople are more inclined to value option availability (Study 1), with this effect being especially pronounced for rule-bound thinkers (Study 2) and those operating under incentive-based compensation plans (Study 3). The article concludes by highlighting key managerial and theoretical implications, while acknowledging limitations and proposing directions for related, future work.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Postmenopausal women have increased wave reflection (augmentation pressure (AP) and index (Alx)) and reduced muscle function that predispose them to cardiac diseases and disability. Our aim was to examine the combined and independent effects of whole-body vibration training (WBVT) and kcitnilline supplementation on aortic hemodynamics and plasma nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) in postmenopausal women. Forty-one obese postmenopausal women were randomized to 3 groups: WBVT+L-citnilline and WBVT+Placebo for 8 weeks. Brachial and aortic systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, AP, Alx, Alx adjusted to 75 beats/min (Alxg75), and NOx were measured before and after 8 weeks. All groups similarly decreased (P < 0.05) brachial and aortic pressures as well as AP, and similarly increased (P < 0.05) NOx levels. Alx and Alx@75 decreased (P < 0.01) in the WBVT+kcitrulline and WBVT+Placebo groups, but not in the L-citrulline group. The improvement in Alxg75 (-10.5%+/- 8.8%, P < 0.05) in the WBVT+L-citrulline group was significant compared with the kcitrulline group. L-Citrulline supplementation and WBVT alone and combined decreased blood pressures. The combined intervention reduced Alxg75. This study supports the effectiveness of WBVT+L-citrulline as a potential intervention for prevention of hypertension-related cardiac diseases in obese postmenopausal women.",

      "Abstract Note" : "When maximizing the effectiveness and equity in hurricane disaster relief provision, most research has explored the needs of various socioeconomic groups. Besides income, the age of the population can also be an important metric of equity, as evidenced by the disproportionate death toll in New Orleans' aging population caused by Hurricane Katrina. Yet emergency management and transportation research has not given sufficient consideration to the impacts of age-based demand on the provision of disaster relief. This paper looks at relief distribution to non-evacuating populations in a post-disaster disaster setting to compare the accessibility to relief of the aging vs. other populations. A p-median based modeling framework linked to a geographic information system (GIS) is employed to explore the influence of the age of potential hurricane non-evacuees on the decision of where to site relief distribution facilities in Leon County, Florida. It was found that the average travel time between neighborhoods and sited nearest facilities varies as a function of demand specifications with the Population age 65 and over tending to bear a relatively higher burden of the travel time, which may limit their accessibility to post-disaster relief in comparison with the Total Population as well as those aged under 65. Changing how relief demand is represented (in terms of age) results in changes to the sited relief facilities' spatial layouts. Our results suggest the need for emergency planners to consider aging populations and their disaster-related needs into future planning efforts to ensure a more equitable disaster relief distribution system.

      "Abstract Note" : "Mild, unavoidable deviations from circular-symmetry of instrumental beams along with scan strategy can give rise to measurable Statistical Isotropy (SI) violation in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. If not accounted properly, this spurious signal can complicate the extraction of other SI violation signals (if any) in the data. However, estimation of this effect through exact numerical simulation is computationally intensive and time consuming. A generalized analytical formalism not only provides a quick way of estimating this signal, but also gives a detailed understanding connecting the leading beam anisotropy components to a measurable BipoSH characterisation of SI violation. In this paper, we provide an approximate generic analytical method for estimating the SI violation generated due to a non-circular (NC) beam and arbitrary scan strategy, in terms of the Bipolar Spherical Harmonic (BipoSH) spectra. Our analytical method can predict almost all the features introduced by a NC beam in a complex scan and thus reduces the need for extensive numerical simulation worth tens of thousands of CPU hours into minutes long calculations. As an illustrative example, we use WMAP beams and scanning strategy to demonstrate the easability, usability and efficiency of our method. We test all our analytical results against that from exact numerical simulations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study examines the effect of prison versus community sanctions on recommitment to prison and compares two levels of community supervision, community control (house arrest) and probation, evaluating whether the findings are contingent on the type of matching methods used in the analysis. Logistic regression was conducted on unmatched and matched samples. Exact, coarsened exact, and radius-matching procedures were used to create a selection on observables design. Matching variables included current offense, demographics, criminal history, supervision violations, and a rich set of Florida Sentencing Guidelines information culled from an official scoring sheet. Florida judges use this instrument to sentence offenders within the framework of the state determinate sentencing system. The results show that with exact matching, there is no effect of imprisonment on recommitment, while the other procedures suggest a specific deterrent effect of imprisonment. All four analysis methods showed that offenders under community control are more likely to reoffend than those under normal probation. Analyses between the matched and unmatched prison observations demonstrate that the matched set of prisoners is composed of offenders who have less extensive criminal records and less serious conviction offenses than unmatched offenders regardless of the matching algorithm. Contrary to a prior analysis of these data, which found a criminogenic effect of prison, a null effect was found using exact matching. Comparing the matching procedures, the more precise the match the less likely there was an effect of prison. However, community control was criminogenic regardless of the matching procedure.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Overproduction of type I collagen is associated with a wide range of fibrotic diseases as well as surgical failure such as in glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS). Its modulation is therefore of clinical importance. Valproic acid (VPA) is known to reduce collagen in a variety of tissues with unclear mechanism of action. In this report, we demonstrate that VPA inhibited collagen production in both conjunctival fibroblasts and the mouse model of GFS. In fibroblasts, VPA decreased type I collagen expression which intensified with longer drug exposure and suppressed steady-state type I collagen promoter activity. Moreover, VPA decreased Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4 but increased Smad6 expression with a similar intensity-exposure profile. Reduction of Smad3 using small hairpin RNA and/or overexpression of Smad6 resulted in decreased collagen expression which was exacerbated when VPA was simultaneously present. Furthermore, fibrogenic TGF-beta 2 failed to induce collagen when VPA was present, as opposed to the myofibroblast markers, beta-actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C, which were elevated by TGF-beta 2. VPA suppressed p3TP-Lux luciferase activity and selectively rescued Smad6 expression from suppression by TGF-beta 2. Notably, SMAD6 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of TGF-beta 2 in inducing collagen expression. In corroboration, VPA inhibited type I collagen but increased Smad6 expression in the late phase of wound healing in the mouse model of GFS. Taken together, our data indicate that VPA has the capacity to effectively suppress both steady-state and fibrogenic activation of type I collagen expression by modulating Smad expression. Hence, VPA is potentially applicable as an anti-fibrotic therapeutic by targeting collagen.",

The results of Study 1 were reproduced, with participants more than twice as likely to wear school-affiliated apparel after wins and 55% less likely after losses. The study also extends the BIRGing literature in its investigation of the influence of gender and the effect's salience over time. Study 2's results were not reproduced. However, study participants were significantly more likely to use first-person plural pronouns, providing further empirical evidence of BIRGing behaviors.

      "Abstract Note" : "The growth of sport sponsorship has led to an increase in the number of studies measuring sponsorship outcomes in different sport settings. Most studies, however, have focused on understanding the factors leading to purchase intentions. A more accurate assessment of sponsorship effectiveness would come through measuring actual purchase behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine a sport sponsorship model that included awareness, fit, attitude toward the sponsor, past purchases, purchase intentions, and actual purchases. Data were collected via longitudinal web surveys conducted with soccer fans from the United States. The results of a structural equation model provided evidence that the relationships among the analyzed sponsorship outcomes did not have a significant effect on actual purchase behaviors. The discussion includes questions about the impact of sponsorship variables such as awareness, fit, attitude toward the sponsor, purchase intentions, and past purchases on actual purchase behaviors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A wealth of research has revealed that a shorter duration of breastfeeding during infancy can increase the risk of various maladaptive traits, including neuropsychological deficits. Despite the number of studies that have been conducted on the topic, few studies have explored whether the effects of breastfeeding on neuropsychological functioning and personality features persist into adulthood. Furthermore, very little research to date has examined whether this relationship is moderated by specific indicators of genetic risk. The current study examines the direct and interactive effects of breastfeeding experiences and the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) on neuropsychological deficits and psychopathic personality traits. Using data from the National Longitudinal study of Adolescent Health, we find that no exposure to breastfeeding and a shorter duration of breastfeeding significantly increase the risk of exhibiting neuropsychological deficits during adolescence and early adulthood as well as psychopathic personality traits during adulthood. The results also reveal a number of gene 9 environment interactions between 5HTTLPR, breastfeeding exposure and breastfeeding duration in the prediction of neuropsychological deficits, but not in the prediction of psychopathic personality traits.",

An initial sample (N=185) underwent laboratory assessments of central aortic blood pressure and myocardial functioning to investigated the association between mindfulness and cardiac functioning. Controlling for religiosity, mindfulness demonstrated a strong negative relationship with myocardial oxygen consumption and left ventricular work but not heart rate or blood pressure. A second sample (N=124) underwent a brief (15min) mindfulness inducing intervention to examine the influence of mindfulness on cardiovascular autonomic modulation via blood pressure variability and heart rate variability. The intervention had a strong positive effect on cardiovascular modulation by decreasing cardiac sympathovagal tone, vasomotor tone, vascular resistance and ventricular workload. This research establishes a link between mindfulness and cardiovascular functioning via correlational and experimental methodologies in samples of mostly female undergraduates. Future directions for research are outlined.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Dari-Mattiacci, Guerriero, and Huang (2016, henceforth DGH), construct a model in which certain goods may be stolen from their owners (O) by intermediaries (or thieves) (I) and be sold to buyers (B). In these and similar circumstances, the law (if the stolen good can be identified) may take the good from the buyer and assign it to its previous owner (henceforth, pro-owner rules), or may decide to leave it where it is (henceforth, pro-buyer rules). DGH study the implications of their model, and thereby conclude that the normative desirability of pro-buyer versus pro-owner rules hinges primarily on who values the good more. Below, I provide comments regarding DGH's model and their interpretation of it. While doing so, I make frequent references to the notation and results described in DGH.

      "Abstract Note" : "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic construct associated with several anxiety and related disorders. Three studies were conducted to explore the potential relationship between IU and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Study 1 revealed a positive relationship between IU and BDD symptoms above symptoms of anxiety and depression in an unselected student sample (N = 88). Study 2 demonstrated a similar relationship between IU and BDD symptoms above negative affectivity and intolerance of ambiguity in a community sample (N=116). Study 3 found that a clinical BDD sample (N=23) reported greater IU than healthy controls (N=20), though this relationship was accounted for by symptoms of anxiety and depression. Greater IU predicted functional impairment in the clinical sample above BDD symptoms and past-week anxiety and depression. The observed relationship between IU and BDD symptoms provides preliminary support for the relevance of IU to this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Following recent scholarship on place and place-making, we identify key challenges for contemporary empirical research using the \"Right to the City\" as an analytic. We seek to distinguish between the aspirational \"right\" articulated as a political and conceptual call to arms on one hand, and the \"actually existing rights\" that are carved out through both formal and informal mechanisms (including political protest) in the everyday city on the other. Actually existing rights are defined not through fiat or via momentary revolutionary acts, but through the durability of relationships between multiple actors, including residents, citizens, states, and corporate agents. We re-articulate urban rights as actually contingent and agonistic properties of the relationships that citizens have with places. This paper uses the historic conflict over community gardens in New York as an illustration of how thinking of rights regimes as multiple, overlapping, and placed helps better illuminate potential political interventions. Thinking of rights and places as plural, overlapping, and contingent is analytically productive because it highlights (rather than overwriting) conflicts between competing articulations of rights and privileges in cities.

Yet recent evidence has suggested that people do not spend much time actively thinking about the past. The articles in this special issue reflect a growing sentiment that prospection should be a central focus of psychology. They are about 2 central themes: prediction and pragmatic planning. Prediction studies are largely about when people make predictions and their accuracy (including what mistakes people make). Pragmatic planning, which from evolutionary standpoints might be the more common and basic form of thinking about the future, involves anticipating what a person will have to do, decide, perform. The 2 approaches are quite compatible: prediction in service of pragmatic adjustments would be highly adaptive. To accurately imagine what might happen is likely not an end to itself, because that alone does not enable a person to make changes or ready oneself for the event if and when it comes to fruition. The articles in this special issue-whether on prospection, prediction, pragmatic planning, or prediction in service of preparation and planning-suggest avenues to pave the way for psychology's brightest future.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In the present, the past is more knowable than the future-but people think far more about the future than the past. Both facts derive from the principle that the future can be changed whereas the past cannot. Our theory of pragmatic prospection holds that people think about the future so as to guide actions to bring about desirable outcomes. It proposes that thoughts about the future begin by imagining what one wants to happen, which is thus initially optimistic. A second stage of such prospective thinking maps out how to bring that about, and this stage is marked by consideration of obstacles, requisite steps, and other potential problems, and so it tends toward cautious realism and even pessimism. Pragmatic prospection presents a form of teleology, in which brains can anticipate possible future events and use those cognitions to guide behavior. Toward that end, it invokes meaning, consistent with evidence that thinking about the future is highly meaningful. Prospection often has narrative structure, involving a series of events in a temporal sequence linked together by meaning. Emotion is useful for evaluating different simulations of possible future events and plans. Prospection is socially learned and rests on socially constructed scaffolding for the future (e.g., future dates). Planning is perhaps the most common form of prospection, and it exemplifies all aspects of our theory (including pragmatic utility, meaning, teleological and narrative structure, and sociality). Bracing for bad news and defensive pessimism are strategies that inspire adaptive responses to feared outcomes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Many mental health and religious professionals have long argued that belief in human sinfulness is associated with poor mental health. Others argue that the deleterious mental health effects of belief in sinfulness may be buffered by a concomitant belief in divine forgiveness, which may itself have positive mental health benefits. We test these ideas using data from a national survey of US adults (N = 1629). Our results indicate a positive association between belief in human sinfulness and all eight classes of psychiatric symptoms we examine, and a negative relationship between belief in being divinely forgiven and six of the classes of psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, there are significant interaction effects between believing humans to be sinful and belief in being forgiven for seven of the eight outcomes such that the net effects of believing in sin on mental health are attenuated for those who believe they have experienced God's forgiveness in their lives. Among those who report feeling forgiven by God \"many times,\" belief in human sinfulness is only associated with four of the psychiatric outcomes, and these associations are modest in size. Our findings provide partial support for the idea that belief in sinfulness is bad for mental health, but also show that religious beliefs are best understood in relation to other beliefs. Believing in human sinfulness is not necessarily harmful if it is accompanied by belief in having experienced divine forgiveness. This study contributes to a growing body of research explicating the relationships among religious beliefs and mental health.",

Principal component regression is used for extracting damage sensitive features of a Lamb wave sensor signal and establish a relation between the features and measured areas. A Wiener process is developed to model the random delamination growth and predict future damage and failure time probability. We use minimum squared prediction error to find the optimum number of features and the window inside a Lamb wave signal that is most sensitive to the fatigue damage. Method is illustrated on real sensor data collected under run-to-failure fatigue loading conditions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "First responders police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and paramedics-experience significant job-related stressors and exposures that may confer increased risk for mental health morbidities (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], suicidal thoughts and behaviors) and hastened mortality (e.g., death by suicide). Inherent in these occupations, however, are also factors (e.g., camaraderie, pre-enlistment screening) that may inoculate against the development or maintenance of psychiatric conditions. Several reviews of the literature have documented the prevalence and potency of PTSD among first responders; the value of these extant reviews is considerable. Nonetheless, the literature has not been systematically described with regard to suicidality. In this systematic review, we present 63 quantitative studies examining suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and/or fatalities among first responders; identify population-specific risk and protective factors; and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses of the existing literature. Findings reveal elevated risk for suicide among first responders; however, studies utilizing more rigorous methodologies (e.g., longitudinal designs, probability sampling strategies) are sorely needed. First responders have an armamentarium of resources to take care of others; it is the duty of researchers, clinicians, and the public to aid in taking care of their health as well, in part by reducing suicide risk.

Participants included 196 students with ASD and their educators (n = 126) who were video-recorded at the beginning of the school year. Findings documented limited active engagement overall, with students spending less than half of the observation well-regulated, productive, or independent and infrequently directing eye gaze and communicating. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the structure of the CMAE was represented by a 5-factor model. These findings underscore the need for improved active engagement in students with ASD and show promise for a tool to measure behaviors associated with positive educational outcomes in students with ASD.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The pattern of increased body size in colder climates, or Bergmann's rule, is common in endotherms. However, empirical support has been mixed among clades, and it varies among taxonomic levels. Taking advantage of greatly improved phylogenetic resolution among rodents, we tested Bergmann's rule using 19 bioclimatic variables, and body mass data, for 1315 species on a recent supermatrix phylogeny. We did not find the predicted negative relationship between body mass and temperature. Instead, phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analysis indicated that precipitation variables (especially variables associated with primary productivity) had a positive correlation with body mass, suggesting that rodent species tend to be larger in more productive regions. Multivariate regression between body mass and overall climate (based on 19 bioclimatic variables) found a significant relationship, that was robust to phylogenetic correction. Bergmann's rule was not detected in smaller and surface-dwelling rodents (despite their greater exposure to external climate), any more than in larger and subterranean rodents. We suggest that food availability, and not heat conservation, is the more important mechanism driving body size variation across rodent species at the order level.

      "Abstract Note" : "We develop a combinatorial approach to represent and infer semantic interpretations of video contents using tools from Grenander's pattern theory. Semantic structures for video interpretation are formed using generators and bonds, the fundamental units of representation in pattern theory. Generators represent features and ontological items, such as actions and objects, whereas bonds are threads used to connect generators while respecting appropriate constraints. The resulting configurations of partially-connected generators are termed scene interpretations. Our goal is to parse a given video data set into high-probability configurations. The probabilistic models are imposed using energies that have contributions from both data (classification scores) and prior information (ontological constraints, co-occurrence frequencies, etc). The search for optimal configurations is based on an MCMC, simulated-annealing algorithm that uses simple moves to propose configuration changes and to accept/reject them according to the posterior energy. In contrast to current graphical methods, this framework does not preselect a neighborhood structure but tries to infer it from the data. The proposed framework is able to obtain 20% higher classification rates, compared to a purely machine learning-based baseline, despite artificial insertion of low-level processing errors. In an uncontrolled scenario, video interpretation performance rates are found to be double that of the baseline. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Quantum chaos has become an important element of our knowledge about physics of complex systems. In typical mesoscopic systems of interacting particles the dynamics invariably become chaotic when the level density, growing by combinatorial reasons, leads to the increasing probability of mixing simple mean-field (particle-hole) configurations. The resulting stationary states have exceedingly complicated structures that are comparable to those in random matrix theory. We discuss the main properties of mesoscopic quantum chaos and show that it can serve as a justification for application of statistical mechanics to mesoscopic systems. We show that quantum chaos becomes a powerful instrument for experimental, theoretical and computational work. The generalization to open systems and effects in the continuum are discussed with the help of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; it is shown how to formulate this approach for numerous problems of quantum signal transmission. The artificially introduced randomness can also be helpful for a deeper understanding of physics. We indicate the problems that require more investigation so as to be understood further.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hard-bottom 'mesophotic' reefs along the '40-fathom' (73 m) shelf edge in the northern Gulf of Mexico were investigated for potential effects of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill from the Macondo well in April 2010. Alabama Alps Reef, Roughtongue Reef, and Yellowtail Reef were near the well, situated 60-88 m below floating oil discharged during the DWH spill for several weeks and subject to dispersant applications. In contrast, Coral Trees Reef and Madison Swanson South Reef were far from the DWH spill site and below the slick for less than a week or not at all, respectively. The reefs were surveyed by ROV in 2010, 2011, and 2014 and compared to similar surveys conducted one and two decades earlier. Large gorgonian octocorals were present at all sites in moderate abundance including Swiftia exserta, Hypnogorgia pendula, Thesea spp., and Placogorgia spp. The gorgonians were assessed for health and condition in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) research design using still images captured from ROV video transects. Injury was modeled as a categorical response to proximity and time using logistic regression. Condition of gorgonians at sites near Macondo well declined significantly post-spill. Before the spill, injury was observed for 4-9 % of large gorgonians. After the spill, injury was observed in 38-50 % of large gorgonians. Odds of injury for sites near Macondo were 10.8 times higher post-spill, but unchanged at far sites. The majority of marked injured colonies in 2011 declined further in condition by 2014. Marked healthy colonies generally remained healthy. Background stresses to corals, including fishing activity, fishing debris, and coral predation, were noted during surveys, but do not appear to account for the decline in condition at study sites near Macondo well.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Numerous parental emotion socialization factors have been implicated as direct and indirect contributors to the development of children's emotional competence. To date, however, no study has combined parents' emotion-related beliefs, behaviors, and regulation strategies in one model to assess their cumulative-as well as unique-contributions to children's emotion regulation. We considered the 2 components that have recently been distinguished: emotion regulation and emotional lability. We predicted that mothers' beliefs about the value of and contempt for children's emotions, mothers' supportive and nonsupportive reactions to their children's emotions, as well as mothers' use of cognitive reappraisal and suppression of their own emotions would each contribute unique variance to their children's emotion regulation and lability, as assessed by children's teachers. The study sample consisted of an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group of 165 mothers and their third-grade children. Different patterns emerged for regulation and lability: Controlling for family income, child gender, and ethnicity, only mothers' lack of suppression as a regulatory strategy predicted greater emotion regulation in children, whereas mothers' valuing of children's emotions, mothers' lack of contempt for children's emotions, mothers' use of cognitive reappraisal to reinterpret events, and mothers' lack of emotional suppression predicted less lability in children. These findings support the divergence of emotion regulation and lability as constructs and indicate that, during middle childhood, children's lability may be substantially and uniquely affected by multiple forms of parental socialization.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In the absence of disorder, electrons can display glassy behavior through supercooling the liquid state, avoiding the solidification into a charge ordered state. Such supercooled electron liquids are experimentally found in organic oee integral- M M (') compounds. We present theoretical results that qualitatively capture the experimental findings. At intermediate temperatures, the conducting state crosses over into a weakly insulating pseudogap phase. The stripe order phase transition is first order, so that the liquid phase is metastable below T (s) . In the supercooled liquid phase, the resistivity increases further and the density of states at the Fermi level is suppressed, indicating kinetic arrest and the formation of a glassy state. Our results are obtained using classical Extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory.",

Power-law behavior of V(I) is found for both H = 0 and H not equal 0. The critical current I (c) was extracted, and its temperature and magnetic field dependences were studied in detail. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics dominates the nonlinear I-V near the superconducting transition at H = 0, and it continues to contribute up to a characteristic temperature T (x) (H). Nonlinear I-V persists up to an even higher temperature T (h) (H) due to the depinning of vortices.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Angular distributions of the Be-9 + N-15 elastic and inelastic scattering were measured at E-lab(N-15) = 84 MeV (E-c.m. = 31.5 MeV) for the 0-6.76 MeV states of Be-9 and 0-6.32 MeV states of N-15. The data were analyzed within the optical model and coupled-reaction-channels method. The elastic and inelastic scattering, spin reorientations of Be-9 in ground and excited states and N-15 in excited states as well as the most important one- and two-step transfer reactions were included in the channels-coupling scheme. The parameters of the Be-9 + N-15 optical potential of Woods-Saxon form as well as deformation parameters of these nuclei were deduced. The analysis showed that the Be-9 + N-15 pure potential elastic scattering dominates at the forward angles whereas the ground state spin reorientation of Be-9 gives a major contribution to the elastic scattering cross sections at the large angles. Contributions from particle transfers are found to be negligible for the present scattering system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Fragmented (short chain) primary alcohols, fragmented aldehydes and fragmented carboxylic acids are also formed. The variation of the supply voltage and oxygen concentration allows moderate fine-tuning of yield and selectivity of this organic \"diversity-oriented\" synthetic process. A (pH based) procedure for rapid separation of the organic hydroperoxides has been developed. Computationally determined thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of several reaction pathways support their feasibility. The construction of a mechanistic pathway map was accomplished, providing deeper insight into this radical and plasma based transformation process.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background Although physician recommendation is one of the strongest predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, it is unclear for whom physicians are recommending the vaccine. To help guide intervention efforts, this study investigated predictors of participantreported physician recommendation for HPV vaccine among young adults in the USA. Methods Women and men (N=223) aged 18-26 years were recruited online through Craigslist, a popular classified advertisements website. Ads were posted in the 25 largest US cities from September 2013 to March 2014. Participants completed a survey that assessed demographic and sociopolitical characteristics, sexual history, HPV vaccination history, and whether they had ever received a recommendation for HPV vaccine from a physician or healthcare provider. Results Fifty-three per cent reported receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccine and 45% had received >= 1 dose of HPV vaccine. Participants who received a recommendation were over 35 times more likely to receive >= 1 dose of HPV vaccine relative to participants without a recommendation. Bivariable and multivariable correlates of provider recommendation were identified. Results from the multivariable model indicated that younger (aged 18-21 years), female, White participants with health insurance (ie, employer-sponsored or some other type such as military-sponsored) were more likely to report receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccine. Conclusions Results suggest that physician recommendation practices for HPV vaccination vary by characteristics of the patient. Findings underscore the key role of the healthcare provider in promoting HPV vaccination and have important implications for future HPV vaccine interventions with young adults.",

Eighteen triathletes (mean +/- A SD; age 41 +/- A 7.5 years; height 175 +/- A 9 cm; weight 73.5 +/- A 9.8 kg; male n = 14, female n = 4) were assessed before and after each stage of the race. Body mass and composition were measured via bioelectrical impedance, hydration status via urine specific gravity, hormones and muscle damage via venous blood draw, and blood glucose via fingerstick. Following the race, significant changes included reductions in body mass (qualified effect size: trivial), fat mass (moderate), and percent body fat (small); increases in percent total body water (moderate) and urine specific gravity (large); and unchanged absolute total body water and fat-free mass. There were also extremely large increases in creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, aldosterone and cortisol combined with reductions in testosterone (small) and the testosterone:cortisol ratio (moderate). There were associations between post-race aldosterone and total body water (r = -0.504) and changes in cortisol and fat-free mass (r = -0.536). Finally, blood glucose increased in a stepwise manner prior to each stage. Participation in Ultraman Florida leads to fluid retention and dramatic alterations in body composition, muscle health, hormones, and metabolism.",

In this paper, we focus on this key subproblem and study different tools for optimizations on the joint group of rotations and reparameterizations. We develop and analyze a novel Riemannian optimization approach and evaluate its use in shape distance computation and classification using two public datasets. Experiments show significant advantages in computational time and reliability in performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method.

      "Abstract Note" : "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases have high prevalence among the elderly. Many strategies have been established to alleviate the symptoms experienced by affected individuals. Recent studies have shown that exercise helps patients with neurological disorders to regain lost physical abilities. PGC1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF has emerged recently as a critical pathway for neuroprotection. PGC1 alpha is a highly conserved co-activator of transcription factors that preserves and protects neurons against destruction. PGC1 alpha regulates FNDC5 and its processed and secreted peptide Irisin, which has been proposed to play a critical role in energy expenditure and to promote neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. FNDC5 may also increase the expression of the neurotrophic factor BDNF, a neuroprotective agent, in the hippocampus. BDNF is secreted from hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and hypothalamus neurons and initiates intracellular signaling pathways through TrkB receptors. These pathways have positive feedback on CREB activities and lead to enhancement in PGC1 alpha expression in neurons. Therefore, FNDC5 could behave as a key regulator in neuronal survival and development. This review presents recent findings on the PGC1 alpha/FNDC5/BDNF pathway and its role in neuroprotection, and discusses the controversial promise of irisin as a mediator of the positive benefits of exercise.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Medications for obesity management can be divided into 4 groups: antidepressants (naltrexone/bupropion), stimulants (phentermine, phendimetrazine, diethylpropion, phentermine/topiramate), fat blockers (orlistat), and diabetes medications (liraglutide). Each group has specific therapeutic effects, adverse effects, and costs. Two medications are indicated for long-term use in obesity: lorcaserin and orlistat. Other available medications are for short-term use. High cost makes many of these medications inaccessible for underserved and poor patients. Because of misuse potential, many obesity medications are also classified as controlled substances. There are no medications currently approved for use in pregnant or lactating women.",

Analysts who contribute primarily to the Republican Party adopt a more conservative forecasting style. Their earnings forecast revisions are less likely to deviate from the forecasts of other analysts and are less likely to be bold. Their stock recommendations also contain more modest upgrades and downgrades. Overall, these analysts produce better quality research, which is recognized and rewarded by their employers, institutional investors, and the media. Stock market participants, however, do not fully recognize their superior ability as the market reaction following revisions by these analysts is weaker.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Extraversion is a relatively stable and heritable personality trait associated with numerous psychosocial, lifestyle and health outcomes. Despite its substantial heritability, no genetic variants have been detected in previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies, which may be due to relatively small sample sizes of those studies. Here, we report on a large meta-analysis of GWA studies for extraversion in 63,030 subjects in 29 cohorts. Extraversion item data from multiple personality inventories were harmonized across inventories and cohorts. No genome-wide significant associations were found at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level but there was one significant hit at the gene level for a long non-coding RNA site (LOC101928162). Genome-wide complex trait analysis in two large cohorts showed that the additive variance explained by common SNPs was not significantly different from zero, but polygenic risk scores, weighted using linkage information, significantly predicted extraversion scores in an independent cohort. These results show that extraversion is a highly polygenic personality trait, with an architecture possibly different from other complex human traits, including other personality traits. Future studies are required to further determine which genetic variants, by what modes of gene action, constitute the heritable nature of extraversion.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Consumption of sulfate (SO42-) in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) has often been considered to be due solely to anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). However, recent studies show SO42- fluxes into the SMTZ that exceed methane (CH4) fluxes, thereby challenging this conceptual model. Co-occurrence of organoclastic SO42- reduction (oSR) with AOM in the SMTZ has been hypothesized to be the cause for this flux imbalance, but conclusive evidence is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated organic matter cycling in the SMTZ of the organic-rich sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin, California Borderland, and examined the occurrence of oSR within this zone using bulk solute profiles and Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of selected carbon pools. We also tested the hypothesis that the SMTZ acts as an oxidation front not just for CH4, but also for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is produced below the SMTZ and migrates upward. Mass balance calculations for the SMTZ based on reaction stoichiometry and Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of associated carbon fluxes indicate that similar to 35-45% of total SO42- reduction in the SMTZ occurs via oSR, with the remainder attributable to AOM. The delta C-13 value of net DOC production is distinct from that of the fraction of bulk POC undergoing degradation, suggesting that porewater DOC represents a compositionally unique slice of the metabolizable POC pool. DOC diffusing upward at 450 cm is virtually free of C-14 and contain low levels of short-chain organic acids. Radiocarbon mass balance shows that >30% of this pre-aged, and presumably refractory, DOC is removed from the pore waters within or immediately below the SMTZ. Although the SMTZ does not appear to be a major net DOC oxidation front, these results show that DOC dynamics provide unique insights into organic matter processing in these subsurface sediments.

      "Abstract Note" : "We propose a novel decoupled unconditionally stable numerical scheme for the simulation of two-phase flow in a Hele-Shaw cell which is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard-Hele-Shaw system (CHHS) with variable viscosity. The temporal discretization of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is based on a convex-splitting of the associated energy functional. Moreover, the capillary forcing term in the Darcy equation is separated from the pressure gradient at the time discrete level by using an operator-splitting strategy. Thus the computation of the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation is completely decoupled from the update of pressure. Finally, a pressure-stabilization technique is used in the update of pressure so that at each time step one only needs to solve a Poisson equation with constant coefficient. We show that the scheme is unconditionally stable. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme.",

Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2004) have resulted in some strong and unsavoury claims about human agency. These range from the idea that conscious intentions are epiphenomenal to the idea that we all lack free will. In this paper, I propose a new type of response to the various sceptical conclusions about our agency occasioned by both Libet's work and other experiments in this testing paradigm. Indeed, my argument extends to such conclusions drawn from fMRI-based prediction experiments. In what follows, I will provide a brief description of these experiments, sketch arguments one may be tempted to draw on their basis, and argue that such arguments rely on a questionable premise: that experimental subjects have relevant proximal intentions (which, thus far, both proponents and opponents of these arguments agree on).",

Methods: A systematic search identified six eligible studies. Outcomes of interest were physical abuse recurrence, child abuse potential, and parenting stress. Results: Parents receiving PCIT had significantly fewer physical abuse recurrences and significantly greater reductions on the Parenting Stress Index than parents in comparison groups. Reductions in child abuse potential were nonsignificant, although 95% confidence intervals suggest clinically meaningful treatment effects. The studies examining physical abuse recurrence had a medium treatment effect (g = 0.52), while results from pooled effect size estimates for child abuse potential (g = 0.31) and parenting stress (g = 0.35) were small. Conclusions: PCIT appears to be effective at reducing physical abuse recurrence and parenting stress for physically abusive families, with the largest treatment effects seen on long-term physical abuse recurrence. Applications to social work practice are discussed.",

Three studies examined who shows overconfidence and why. Study 1 demonstrated that participants with an entity (fixed) theory of intelligence, those known to avoid negative information, showed significantly more overconfidence than those with more incremental (malleable) theories. In Study 2, participants who were taught an entity theory of intelligence allocated less attention to difficult problems than those taught an incremental theory. Participants in this entity condition also displayed more overconfidence than those in the incremental condition, and this difference in overconfidence was mediated by the observed bias in attention to difficult problems. Finally, in Study 3, directing participants' attention to difficult aspects of the task reduced the overconfidence of those with more entity views of intelligence. Implications for reducing biased self-assessments that can interfere with learning were discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although the essential role of affect transfer has been evidenced in the brand extension literature, scant research has focused on affect transfer when a firm attempts to add sub-brands into its brand portfolio. We conducted a series of four experiments to demonstrate that affect associated with a family brand does in fact transfer to its sub-brand, and the effect is more pronounced for a sub-brand that is closer to (vs distant from) its family brand. Further, the transfer of affect is contingent upon consideration set size and brand loyalty. While affect transfer is observed when consideration set is small, this effect dissipates when consideration set expands; such moderation effect further interacts with consumers' loyalty to a family brand and a competing brand. Our findings caution brand managers to take into account consumers' consideration set size and brand loyalty when managing their brand portfolios.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation was recently introduced and shown to be an integrable infinite dimensional Hamiltonian evolution equation. In this paper a detailed study of the inverse scattering transform of this nonlocal NLS equation is carried out. The direct and inverse scattering problems are analyzed. Key symmetries of the eigenfunctions and scattering data and conserved quantities are obtained. The inverse scattering theory is developed by using a novel left-right Riemann-Hilbert problem. The Cauchy problem for the nonlocal NLS equation is formulated and methods to find pure soliton solutions are presented; this leads to explicit time-periodic one and two soliton solutions. A detailed comparison with the classical NLS equation is given and brief remarks about nonlocal versions of the modified Korteweg-de Vries and sine-Gordon equations are made.",

      "Abstract Note" : "While curiosity about the correlates of mindfulness continues to grow, how mindfulness is related to personality factors remains unclear. Indeed, the relationships between dispositional mindfulness (DM) and one of the most common conceptualizations of personality, the Five Factor Model (FFM) have yielded mixed results. It may be that these mixed findings have resulted from a lack of analytic specificity. This study explored the relationship between DM and the FFM of personality, paying particular attention to the analysis of the mindfulness facets with respect to the FFM using canonical correlation analysis. The total DM score was found to be significantly correlated with each personality factor, with the strongest relationships observed between DM and neuroticism (negatively associated) as well as DM and conscientiousness (positively associated). The canonical correlation analysis provided further evidence of the relationship between DM and the FFM at a finer level of specificity. Three clusters of association emerged between the DM facets and the personality factors: 1) a self-regulation cluster, negatively associated with neuroticism and positively associated with conscientiousness, 2) a self-awareness cluster positively associated with openness, and 3) the conscientious confusion cluster, demonstrated a mixed relationship between conscientiousness and the mindful self-regulation cluster.

Multilevel modeling is used to determine the overall mean effect size of this relationship based on 1,649 effect size estimates drawn from 179 empirical studies and 107 independent data sets. The findings indicate that there is a fairly strong relationship between gang membership and offending (Mz = .227, confidence interval [CI] = [.198, .253]). Bivariate and multivariate moderator analyses not only reveal that this relationship is robust across the vast majority of methodological variations but also show that the gang membership-offending link is stronger when studying active gang members, and weaker in prospective research designs, non-U.S. samples, and when controlling for theoretical confounders and mediators. These results affirm the efforts of researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to understand and respond to gang behaviors, and are used to identify aspects of this literature that are most worthy of continued attention.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Crowdsourcing can be a cost-effective method for tackling the problem of digitizing historical biocollections data, and a number of crowdsourcing platforms have been developed to facilitate interaction with the public and to design simple \"Human Intelligence Tasks\". However, the problem of reaching consensus on the response of the crowd is still challenging for tasks for which a simple majority vote is inadequate. This paper (a) describes the challenges faced when trying to reach consensus on data transcribed by different workers, (b) offers consensus algorithms for textual data, (c) implements a consensus-based controller to assign a dynamic number of workers per task and per field of a task, (d) proposes the use of clustering to further eliminate redundant work and (e) proposes enhancements of future crowdsourcing task assignments in order to minimize the need for complex consensus algorithms. Experiments using the proposed algorithms show multifold increase in the ability to reach consensus when compared to majority voting using exact string matching. In addition, the workforce controller is able to decrease the crowdsourcing cost per task and per task field by 37% and 50%, respectively, when compared to a strategy that uses a fixed number of workers. The accuracy of clustering is also good and it has the potential to increase the quality of tasks that can be clustered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Recent evidence suggests an association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Cognitive anxiety sensitivity has also been implicated as a precursor to various forms of overarousal. These manifestations of overarousal (i.e., agitation, insomnia, nightmares, and anger) may account for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Methods: In Study 1, undergraduate students selectively sampled for recent suicidal ideation completed all measures online. In Study 2, clinical outpatients completed all measures prior to their initial intake appointments at a psychology clinic. Results: Study 1 demonstrated that agitation and insomnia individually and jointly accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, controlling for general anxiety and demographic variables. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings, such that, controlling for demographics, general anxiety, and physical and social anxiety sensitivity, agitation and anger each independently and together accounted for the association between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation, whereas insomnia and nightmares did not. Limitations: This study utilized a cross-sectional design and self-report measures in both samples as well as a sample of undergraduate students in Study 1. Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that agitation and anger may explain the previously established relationship between cognitive anxiety sensitivity and suicidal ideation. Targeting cognitive anxiety sensitivity in treatment may in turn reduce these forms of overarousal and thereby suicide risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A valid brand embarrassment tendency scale seeks to measure individual differences in people's proneness to feel embarrassed in relation to brands. Three studies identify potential items and validate the scale. In Study 1, with a sample of 338 German respondents, factor analyses and comprehensive validation procedures indicate one dimension that represents embarrassment tendency in relation to branded products. In Study 2, with a sample of 231 U.S. participants, a confirmatory factor analysis of the one-dimensional scale reveals its nomological validity. Study 3 applies the scale to two specific brands, with acceptable levels of reliability and validity. The results thus suggest the new scale is reliable, valid, parsimonious, and generalizable in two Western cultures. The brand embarrassment construct is useful for both developing theory and providing advice to marketing practitioners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: This article examines the impact of distal prison placements on inmate social ties. Specifically, we test whether distance adversely affects inmates by reducing their access to family and friends and then test whether the effects are amplified for minorities and inmates who come from socially disadvantaged areas. Methods: These questions are assessed using a sample of inmates that includes all convicted felony offenders admitted to a single state's prison system over a three-year period. Results: We find that inmates vary greatly in the distance from which they are placed from home and that Latinos are placed more distally than Blacks and Whites. We also find that distance and community disadvantage adversely affect the likelihood of inmate visitation. Although the adverse effect of distance appears to be similar across racial and ethnic groups, a difference exists among Blacksfor this group, high levels of community disadvantage amplify the adverse effects of distance. Conclusions: This study identifies an important dimension along which incarceration may adversely impact inmates, their families, and the communities from which they come, and how these effects may be patterned in ways that disproportionately affect minorities and prisoners from disadvantaged areas.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Cochlea removal results in the death of 20-30% of neurons in the chick cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Two potentially cytotoxic events, a dramatic rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) and a decline in the integrity of ribosomes are observed within 1 h of deafferentation. Glutamatergic input from the auditory nerve has been shown to preserve NM neuron health by activating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), maintaining both normal [Ca2+](i) and ribosomal integrity. One interpretation of these results is that a common mGluR-activated signaling cascade is required for the maintenance of both [Ca2+](i) and ribosomal integrity. This could happen if both responses are influenced directly by a common messenger, or if the loss of mGluR activation causes changes in one component that secondarily causes changes in the other. The present studies tested this common-mediator hypothesis in slice preparations by examining activity-dependent regulation of [Ca2+](i) and ribosomes in the same tissue after selectively blocking group I mGluRs (1-Aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA)) or group II mGluRs (LY 341495) during unilateral auditory nerve stimulation. Changes in [Ca2+](i) of NM neurons were measured using fura-2 ratiometric calcium imaging and the tissue was subsequently processed for Y10B immunoreactivity (Y10B-ir), an antibody that recognizes a ribosomal epitope. The group I mGluR antagonist blocked the activity-dependent regulation of both [Ca2+](i) and Y10B-ir, but the group II antagonist blocked only the activity-dependent regulation of Y10B-ir. That is, even when group II receptors were blocked, stimulation continued to maintain low [Ca2+](i), but it did not maintain Y10B-ir. These results suggest a dissociation in how calcium and ribosomes are regulated in NM neurons and that ribosomes can be regulated through a mechanism that is independent of calcium regulation.

Application of SPMO refined the solidified structure and reoriented the growth direction of columnar grains. Surface oscillations induced by electromagnetic force resulted in grain refinement while the corresponding forced convection contributed to change of growth direction of columnar grains.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper proposes an individual phase current control (IPCC) method based on optimal zero-sequence current separation for star-connected cascade STATCOMs under unbalanced grid voltage. The IPCC is adopted to get better adaptation to unbalanced conditions. Each cluster of the cascade STATCOM has its own phase current control loop and dc-voltage feedback loop, and it can generate the necessary negative-sequence current automatically to rebalance power. However, the zero-sequence current which is unnecessary and harmful in star configuration is introduced in the process. An optimal zero-sequence current separation is presented to remove the zero-sequence current by reconstructing the reactive current command. This improved IPCC enables star-connected STATCOMs adapt to unbalanced conditions without the need for any power balancing algorithms. Also, the operation range of the proposed control method is analyzed. Simulation research studies are performed to verify the operation range analysis, and the experimental operation is tested on a 25-level +/- 10 Mvar/10-kV STATCOM product installed at a wind farm.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In single-phase photovoltaic (PV) system, there is double-frequency power mismatch existed between the dc input and ac output. The double-frequency ripple (DFR) energy needs to be buffered by passive network. Otherwise, the ripple energy will flow into the input side and adversely affect the PV energy harvest. In a conventional PV system, electrolytic capacitors are usually used for this purpose due to their high capacitance. However, electrolytic capacitors are considered to be one of the most failure prone components in a PV inverter. In this paper, a capacitance reduction control strategy is proposed to buffer the DFR energy in single-phase Z-source/quasi-Z-source inverter applications. Without using any extra hardware components, the proposed control strategy can significantly reduce the capacitance requirement and achieve low input voltage DFR. Consequently, highly reliable film capacitors can be used. The increased switching device voltage stress and power loss due to the proposed control strategy will also be discussed. A 1-kW quasi-Z-source PV inverter using gallium nitride (GaN) devices is built in the lab. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

With data from a national telephone survey of non-Latino adults (N=1,364), we estimate the predictors of perceived criminal threat as well as the effects of perceived threat and other factors on immigration policy preferences. Results indicate that political ideology and education are the strongest predictors of perceived criminal threat. Perceived criminal threat has the greatest influence on support for more punitive controls and partially mediates the effects of race, education, political ideology, and contextual threat on these control preferences. Future social threat research should consider the inclusion of perceptual threat measures instead of relying solely on contextual indicators of threat. In addition, contextual threat should be explored more often in dynamic, rather than static, terms.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Microtine rodents display diverse patterns of social organization and behaviors, and thus provide a useful model for studying the effects of the social environment on physiology and behavior. The current study compared the species differences and the effects of oxytocin (OT) on anxiety-like, social affiliation, and social recognition behaviors in female meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Furthermore, cell proliferation and survival in the brains of adult female meadow and prairie voles were compared. We found that female meadow voles displayed a higher level of anxiety-like behavior but lower levels of social affiliation and social recognition compared to female prairie voles. In addition, meadow voles showed lower levels of cell proliferation (measured by Ki67 staining) and cell survival (measured by BrdU staining) in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and amygdala (AMY), but not the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG), than prairie voles. Interestingly, the numbers of new cells in the VMH and AMY, but not DG, also correlated with anxiety-like, social affiliation, and social recognition behaviors in a brain region-specific manner. Finally, central OT treatment (200 ng/kg, icv) did not lead to changes in behavior or cell proliferation/survival in the brain. Together, these data indicate a potential role of cell proliferation/survival in selected brain areas on different behaviors between vole species with distinct life strategies. (C) 2015 IBRO.

To ensure effectiveness, educational strategies must take into consideration the readiness of consumers to learn the curriculum. Behavioral economics highlights the obstacles that educators face in promoting financial efficacy. Such obstacles include envy, fear, greed, and other all too familiar human failings. One innovative model, mindfulness, provides insight into the human dynamics of personal financial behaviors. This article ties together financial education, mindfulness techniques, and transtheoretical stages of readiness. The impact of gradually introduced educational tasks is presented with an eye toward clients' stages of readiness, and mindfulness addresses the emotional burdens of altering a financially profligate lifestyle.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This article examines the relationship of personal finance in a narrative-based treatment strategy as applied to couples. It builds on behavioral economics as the undergirding of an approach to financial literacy. By matching the treatment strategy with the stages of readiness for change, couples are able to gradually adopt a financially prudent lifestyle. The authors argue that the couples' conflicts about personal financial behaviors are a proxy of underlying problems in intimacy. The use of a narrative-based theory addresses how personal finances are used to control relationships.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (2-RDM) methods can provide a reference-independent description of the electronic structure of strongly correlated molecules and materials. These methods represent one of few ways of performing large active-space-based computations that are beyond the scope of conventional configuration-interaction-based approaches. However, implementations of the method are quite rare, making it difficult for the quantum chemistry community to assess the utility of the approach. Here, we discuss an open-shell implementation of the variational 2-RDM method and explore its ability to describe different spin states in several model systems, including linear hydrogen chains and linear acenes. The largest calculations considered are comparable to complete-active-space computations with 50 electrons in 50 orbitals.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Using fine spatial resolution (similar to 7.6 m) hyperspectral AVIRIS data collected over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we statistically estimated slick lengths, widths and length/width ratios to characterize oil slick morphology for different thickness classes. For all AVIRIS-detected oil slicks (N = 52,100 continuous features) binned into four thickness classes (<= 50 mu m but thicker than sheen, 50-200 mu m, 200-1000 mu m, and >1000 mu m), the median lengths, widths, and length/width ratios of these classes ranged between 22 and 38 m, 7-11 m, and 2.5-3.3, respectively. The AVIRIS data were further aggregated to 30-m (Landsat resolution) and 300-m (MERIS resolution) spatial bins to determine the fractional oil coverage in each bin. Overall, if 50% fractional pixel coverage were to be required to detect oil with thickness greater than sheen for most oil containing pixels, a 30-m resolution sensor would be needed.

We computed the mean- squared displacement, and applied weighted least squares with statistical bootstrap to infer the self- diffusivity and the associated uncertainty from these long simulations. We investigated the effect of limited simulations by using only a subset of these long simulations. We found that using np, 300 and tsim= t, 3 was a safe choice that led to relatively stable estimates of the mean self- diffusivity. We considered simulations of much poorer quality, np similar to 128 and t,similar to 0: 7 tau 2 2 tau, and found that the proposed method accurately reflected the uncertainty even in the shortest simulations. This is in contrast with the standard practice of using 2- 3 independent simulation runs to characterise uncertainty, which not only underestimates the true uncertainty in poor data- sets, but is also computationally more demanding.",

An investigation of the excitonic spin-splitting of a disordered multiple quantum well embedded in a wide parabolic quantum well is presented. The results for polarization-resolved photoluminescence show that the magnetic field dependencies of the excitonic spin-splitting and photoluminescence linewidth are crucially sensitive to magnetic field orientation. Our experimental results are in good agreement with the calculated Zeeman splitting obtained by the Luttinger model, which predicts a hybridization of the spin character of states in the valence band under tilted magnetic fields.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The idea of collective victimhood', as a cultural and political identity, has long been cultivated by the state within the construction of Chinese nationalism. Through a case study analysis of Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen, this study examines the cultural pedagogy behind the national production and consumption of such victimhood'. We argue that the allegations of Ye Shiwen's doping by Western media in 2012 London Olympics animates a deep sense of victim mentality in the Chinese public sphere. Here, the Olympic stage is performing both an image of the victor' for national pride and an autonomous victim' profile for state legitimation. This study therefore explores the pedagogical normalization of victim identity in Chinese society exercised through the victimization' efforts oriented around Chinese athletes. It also examines the function of collective memory in (re)shaping and transforming such victimhood into a delicately nuanced and productive collective victimhood intersecting with China's future political dynamics.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Deep-sea ecosystems encompass unique and often fragile communities that are sensitive to a variety of anthropogenic and natural impacts. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, sampling efforts documented the acute impact of the spill on some deep-sea coral colonies. To investigate the impact of the DWH spill on quality and quantity of biomass delivered to the deep-sea, a suite of geochemical tracers (e.g., stable and radio-isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and compound-specific isotopes) was measured from monthly sediment trap samples deployed near a high-density deep-coral site in the Viosca Knoll area of the north-central Gulf of Mexico prior to (Oct-2008 to Sept-2009) and after the spill (Oct-10 to Sept-11). Marine (e.g., autochthonous) sources of organic matter (OM) dominated the sediment traps in both years, however after the spill, there was a pronounced reduction in marine-sourced OM, including a reduction in marine-sourced sterols and n-alkanes and a concomitant decrease in sediment trap organic carbon and pigment flux. Results from this study indicate a reduction in primary production and carbon export to the deep-sea in 2010-2011, at least 6-18 months after the spill started. Whereas satellite observations indicate an initial increase in phytoplankton biomass, results from this sediment trap study define a reduction in primary production and carbon export to the deep-sea community. In addition, a dilution from a low-C-14 carbon source (e.g., petro-carbon) was detected in the sediment trap samples after the spill, in conjunction with a change in the petrogenic composition. The data presented here fills a critical gap in our knowledge of biogeochemical processes and sub-acute impacts to the deep-sea that ensued after the 2010 DWH spill. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Magnetization measurements for magnetic fields mu H-0 up to 60 T are reported for the noncentrosymmetric spin-chain metal Yb2Fe12P7. These measurements reveal behavior that is consistent with Ising-like spin chain magnetism that produces pronounced spin degeneracy. In particular, we find that although a Brillouin field dependence is observed in M(H) for H perpendicular to c with a saturation moment that is close to the expected value for free ions of Yb3+, non-Brillouin-like behavior is seen for H parallel to c with an initial saturation moment that is nearly half the free ion value. In addition, hysteretic behavior that extends above the ordering temperature T-M is seen for H parallel to c but not for H perpendicular to c, suggesting out-of-equilibrium physics. This point of view is strengthened by the observation of a spin reconfiguration in the ordered state for H parallel to c which is only seen for T <= T-M and after polarizing the spins. Together with the heat capacity data, these results suggest that the anomalous low temperature phenomena that were previously reported (Baumbach 2010 et al Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 106403) are driven by spin degeneracy that is related to the Ising-like one dimensional chain-like configuration of the Yb ions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The rare-earth kagome systems R3Ga5SiO14 (R = Nd or Pr) exhibit cooperative paramagnetism at low temperatures. Evidence for correlated spin clusters in these weakly frustrated systems has previously been obtained from neutron scattering and from ESR and NMR results. The present pulsed field (0-60 T, 25 ms) magnetization measurements made on single crystals of Nd3Ga5SiO14 (NGS) and Pr3Ga5SiO14 (PGS) at temperatures down to 450 mK have revealed striking differences in the magnetic responses of the two materials. For NGS the magnetization shows a low field plateau, saturation in high transient fields, and significant hysteresis while the PGS magnetization does not saturate in transient fields up to 60 T and shows no hysteresis or plateaus. Nd3+ is a Kramers ion while Pr3+ is a non-Kramers ion and the crystal field effects are quite different in the two systems. For the conditions used in the experiments the magnetization behavior is not in agreement with Heisenberg model predictions for kagome systems in which easy-axis anisotropy is much larger than the exchange coupling. The extremely slow spin dynamics found below 4 K in NGS is, however, consistent with the model for Kramers ions and provides a basis for explaining the pulsed field magnetization features.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Embryos of live-bearing elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) must acquire oxygen in the uterus for several months to more than a year, but the mechanisms of delivery and uptake are still largely unknown. Diagnostic sonography performed on a captive Japanese dogfish (Squalus japonicus) showed that a late stage embryo used buccal movement to pump uterine fluid, suggesting that the embryo acquires oxygen from uterine fluid via gill ventilation. It has been assumed that embryonic respiration in aplacental sharks depends on oxygen supplied by the uterine wall. To test this hypothesis, the rate of oxygen diffusion was estimated by applying a physical model to the uterine wall of two dogfish species (Squalus cf. mitsukurii and Squalus cubensis). The model calculations indicate that the supply of oxygen via diffusion through the uterine villi contributes less than 15-30% of the total oxygen demand of late-stage embryos. Some previous authors have suggested that pregnant dogfish intermittently exchange uterine fluid with external seawater during late gestation. Thus, late-stage embryos may acquire oxygen primarily from uterine seawater introduced from the external environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The structure and variability of the Ryukyu Current System (RCS), which forms the western boundary current along the eastern slope of the Ryukyu Islands, are studied using results from a 32-layer, 1/12.5 degrees global HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) reanalysis for the period 19932012. It is confirmed that the reanalysis realistically reproduces salient features of the observed currents at three sections southeast of Miyakojima, Okinawa and Amami-Ohshima. The mean velocity sections show well-developed subsurface velocity maxima between 700 and 900 m. The current core southeast of Amami-Ohshima shows year-to-year variations with cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation east of Amami-Ohshima generating weak (strong) velocity cores. Interaction of the RCS with an anticyclonic eddy often produces a two-core velocity structure, with a surface core in the upper 300 m and a deeper core near 700900 m. The horizontal structure of the RCS at 15 m depth shows a well-developed northeastward current northeast of Okinawa, which is partly fed by the southwestward extension of the anticyclonic recirculation gyre. The RCS forms a continuous northeastward current from Miyakojima to Amami-Ohshima below 500 m with shoreward intensification. The circulation at 2000 m shows a seasonal flow reversal, which is northeastward from December to June and southwestward from August to October with July and November being the transition months. The volume transports across these three sections have respective mean values of 0.6, 6.2 and 12.4 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) and standard deviations of 10.2, 7.1 and 11.3 Sv. They have dominant seasonal variations with the maximum in winter and spring and the minimum in summer. The interannual variation of the transport anomaly, which co-varies with the RCS core, results from westward propagating mesoscale eddies arriving from the Pacific interior.

      "Abstract Note" : "Motivation theories have tended to focus on specific motivations, leaving open the intellectually and scientifically challenging problem of how to construct a general theory of motivation. The requirements for such a theory are presented here. The primacy of motivation emphasizes that cognition, emotion, agency, and other psychological processes exist to serve motivation. Both state (impulses) and trait (basic drives) forms of motivation must be explained, and their relationship must be illuminated. Not all motivations are the same, and indeed it is necessary to explain how motivation evolved from the simple desires of simple animals into the complex, multifaceted forms of human motivation. Motivation responds to the local environment but may also adapt to it, such as when desires increase after satiation or diminish when satisfaction is chronically unavailable. Addiction may be a special case of motivation-but perhaps it is much less special or different than prevailing cultural stereotypes suggest. The relationship between liking and wanting, and the self-regulatory management of motivational conflict, also require explanation by an integrative theory.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Luminescent quantum dots (QDs) exhibit size- and composition-tunable photophysical properties that are not shared by their bulk parent materials or at the molecular scale. They have attracted considerable interest further motivated by several potential applications. A particular interest has centered on exploiting the ability of QDs to engage in both fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and charge transfer (CT) interactions with proximal fluorophores and redox active molecules/complexes, respectively. In this review, we highlight how the QD's optical and spectroscopic properties can be controlled via FRET and/or CT interactions. We first show that QDs provide a unique platform for controlling both modes of interactions. We then provide representative examples in biology which include developing sensing assemblies that report on properties such as pH changes, enzymatic activity and ligand receptor binding. Implications in electronic devices focus on light emitting devices and photovoltaic cells, where we discuss device architecture, control over carrier injection, carrier mobility, and exciton recombination.

      "Abstract Note" : "This systematic review aims to develop a bridge between what art therapists know and what they do in supporting those with mental health issues. Research undertaken between 1994 and 2014 was examined to ascertain the art therapy approaches applied when working with people who have mental health issues, as well as to identify how art therapy approaches were used within the clinical mental health system. Thirty articles were identified that demonstrated an art therapy approach to a particular mental health issue. The search strategy resulted in articles being grouped into four diagnostic terms: depression, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. A synthesis of the identified articles resulted in the identification of research areas that need advancement. Future studies could incorporate more details on the art therapy approaches used to enhance transferability of practice. Moreover, adding art therapists' critique about the art therapy approach from their applied perspective, would assist in the development of evidence-based practice that is not just current, but feasible, too. Finally, the client voice needs to be incorporated in future studies to address questions of the relationship between client expectations and the perceived success of art therapy.

      "Abstract Note" : "Families in which one or more members are undocumented immigrants experience unique hardships. Yet, little is known about stress and substance use among adolescents growing up in these families. The present study examined associations between two sources of adolescent stress (i.e., low parental involvement due to contextual constraints and family economic insecurity) and lifetime alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among adolescents in families with undocumented members. The sample was comprised of 102 adolescents (10-18 years old) and one of his or her parents. Participants responded a survey in English or Spanish. Adolescent lifetime use of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana was 51, 32.4, and 37.3 %, respectively. Chi-square analyses found no significant gender differences in lifetime substance use. Logistic regression models showed that adolescent stress due to hindered parental involvement increased the odds of both lifetime cigarette and marijuana use after controlling for gender, age, linguistic acculturation, familism, parental control, and negative peer affiliation. Being a girl increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use. Family economic stress was not associated with lifetime substance use. Results suggest that hindered parental involvement might be a stressor and a risk factor for cigarette and marijuana use among adolescents growing up in families with undocumented members. Because parents in these families are likely to be undocumented, policies that allow immigrants to apply for legal status could improve parents' working conditions and facilitate parental involvement; in turn, such policies could decrease the risk for adolescent substance use among children of Latino immigrants.",

Improving the number sense of this population is an important goal for mathematics teacher education, and researchers have found this goal to be difficult to accomplish. In earlier work, we devised a local instruction theory for the development of number sense, which focused on whole-number mental computation. In this study, the local instruction theory was applied to the rational-number domain, with the help of a framework for reasoning about fraction magnitude, and it guided instruction in the content course. We interviewed seven participants pre- and post-instruction, and we found that their reasoning on fraction comparison tasks improved. The participants made more correct comparisons, reasoned more flexibly, and came to favor less conventional and more sophisticated strategies. These improvements in number sense parallel those that we found previously in mental computation. In addition to the overall results, we highlight two cases of improvement that illustrate ways in which prospective elementary teachers' reasoning about fraction magnitude can change.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The grain boundaries (GBs) of high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) intrinsically limit the maximum achievable inter-grain current density (J(c)), when the misalignment between the crystallographic axes of adjacent grains exceeds a certain value. A prominent effect resulting from large-angle GBs is a hysteresis of Jc between the increasing and decreasing field branches. Here, we investigate this feature for K-and Co-doped Ba-122 polycrystalline bulks with systematically varied grain size and find that the widely accepted explanation for this effect-the return field of the grains-fails. We use large-area scanning Hall-probe microscopy to distinguish Jc from the intra-granular current density (J(G)) in order to clarify their interactions. Measurements on Ba-122 bulks reveal that a large J(c) results from a small JG as well as small grains. An extended version of the model proposed by Svistunov and D'yachenko is successfully applied to quantitatively evaluate this behavior. The excellent agreement between the model and experiments suggests that the GBs limit the macroscopic current in all of the samples and that the inter-grain coupling is governed by Josephson tunneling. The predictions of the model are promising in view of realizing high-field HTS magnets. Our main result is that the field dependence of the J(c) of an untextured wire can be significantly reduced by reducing the grain size, which results in much higher currents at high magnetic fields. This result is not limited to the investigated iron-based materials and is therefore of interest in the context of other HTS materials.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Quench in a pancake wound REBCO superconducting coil with low resistance (LR) between turns is examined by numerical analysis. In these calculations it is generally observed that once established, quench propagates rapidly in LR coils. Large transients are induced in the azimuthal solenoid current, allowed by the LR between turns, and become self-propagating. The transition from an initial state characterized by thermal diffusion to the dynamic inductive state of quench propagation is observed. The analysis is applied to the inner coil of a 30 T magnet where the quench performance is studied as a function of the value of resistance between turns. Rapid propagation of quench is seen in calculations for resistance between turns significantly greater than the resistance reported for no-insulation coils. The influence on quench of both steel co-wind and the amount of copper in the conductor is examined through calculation of the maximum temperature and the quench propagation velocity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although the theological elements of Robert Boyle's mechanical philosophy have received careful scrutiny, his reflections on economic issues have largely been overlooked. This article takes a small step towards redressing this state of affairs. Rather than argue that Boyle like John Locke or David Hume - was as interested in political economy as he was in discovering the nature of Nature, the article treats him as a point of entry for considering how early-modern England negotiated the revolutionary cultural and economic changes that emerged as capitalism took command. More specifically, it uses one of Boyle's less-famous inventions a hydrostatic device for discriminating between real, degraded and counterfeit coinage in order to explore how economic exchange began to acquire a patina of 'objectivity' in the 17th-century imagination.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Empirical evidence has identified several risk factors for panic psychopathology, including smoking and anxiety sensitivity (AS; the fear of anxiety-related sensations). Smokers with elevated AS are therefore a particularly vulnerable population for panic. Yet, there is little knowledge about how to reduce risk of panic among high AS smokers. The present study prospectively evaluated panic outcomes within the context of a controlled randomized risk reduction program for smokers. Participants (N = 526) included current smokers who all received a state-of-the-art smoking cessation intervention with approximately half randomized to the AS reduction intervention termed Panic-smoking Program (PSP). The primary hypotheses focus on examining the effects of a PSP on panic symptoms in the context of this vulnerable population. Consistent with prediction, there was a significant effect of treatment condition on AS, such that individuals in the PSP condition, compared to those in the control condition, demonstrated greater decreases in AS throughout treatment and the follow-up period. In addition, PSP treatment resulted in lower rates of panic-related symptomatology. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that reductions in AS resulted in lower panic symptoms. The present study provides the first empirical evidence that brief, targeted psychoeducational interventions can mitigate panic risk among smokers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The TW benchmark states that the performance of a team for problems with a demonstrable correct solution should be no worse than the performance of its most able individual. If one individual solves the problem, the team solves it as well. Advisees whose advisors play strategically have significantly higher levels of strategic play, but fall well short of the truth wins benchmark as (i) many advisors who play strategically do not provide advice to this effect, and (ii) many advisees fail to follow sound advice. Effect (i) is largely attributable to female advisors who are far less likely to provide advice than men. Whether or not advice contains a clear explanation for its effectiveness has no effect on the likelihood of advisees' strategic play, a result at odds with the idea that economic agents regularly consider all the available alternatives.

We suggest research-based techniques that parents could utilize to reduce the risk of costly food waste, and discuss obstacles that could impede well-intended parents from reaching their goals of improving their children's diets.

      "Abstract Note" : "This study examined the interrelationships between changes in trauma and internalizing symptoms among adolescents in foster care. Using three waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, growth-curve analyses were conducted with a sample of 155 adolescents aged 11-15 in out-of-home care. Findings indicated that the initial level of post-traumatic stress symptoms was significantly associated with the initial level of internalizing symptoms at Wave I and decreases in post-traumatic stress symptoms were significantly associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms from Wave Ito Wave IV. Viewing trauma and internalizing symptoms as interrelated affords increased understanding of ways in which adolescents who have experienced high levels of stress express their needs. As such, it may be clinically beneficial to conduct an evaluation of trauma symptoms for adolescents in foster care, regardless of whether there has been a documented history of a traumatic event. Doing so may provide a more comprehensive view into the underlying influences of adolescent behaviors and help capture a broader clinical picture necessary for effective intervention.

This study focuses on consumer perceptions about sustainable practices used by organic wine suppliers along with consumer attitudes pertaining to organic wine attributes. Results suggest that consumer perceptions of sustainable practices by wine producers affect the outcomes of consumers' decision making relative to organic wine. In addition, this study found that consumer attitudes about organic wine attributes related to the environment, health, and price had significant effects upon behavioral intentions. The moderating effects of trust on these perceptions are also considered. Findings indicate consumers that trust wine retailers are more likely to engage in positive outcomes. Numerous implications regarding organic wine supply chain management and future research are identified.",

A survey conducted with 540 travelers and tourists, which began three weeks following the successful capping of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, reveals that consumers' reactions to the oil spill varied by geographic location and past travel behavior. In particular, consumers from the southeast region, when compared with the three other geographic regions we sampled, had more negative views regarding the oil spill on a number of dependent measures. We also found that individuals who traveled to Florida in the two years prior to the oil spill reported higher perceptions of environmental risk than those individuals who had not traveled to Florida during that same time frame.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In light of recent data demonstrating large variability in the diagnosis of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) within the Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VA), it is important to elucidate VA-specific barriers and facilitators to CUD diagnosis and treatment engagement. This issue is particularly salient among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), given that PTSD is the most common co-occurring psychiatric disorder among veterans with CUD and is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the potential role of system-, clinician-, and patient-level factors associated with both CUD diagnosis and treatment engagement. Key personnel were interviewed from PTSD programs with both low and high rates of CUD and substance use disorder (SUD) programs with both low and high rates of SUD treatment engagement. Common themes emerged across clinics that may represent barriers to CUD diagnosis and treatment engagement and included, for example, clinician's concerns about negative consequences associated with CUD diagnosis (e.g., service connection). Potential facilitators to CUD diagnosis and treatment also emerged and included the use of formal assessment approaches when evaluating veterans for SUDs. Together, findings suggest opportunities, such as CUD-specific education and training for clinicians, to improve VA care.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A popular perception is that landfalling tropical cyclones help to mitigate droughts in the Southeastern United States (SeUS). However intriguing paradigms on the role of large scale SST variations on continental US including SeUS droughts and seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity confronts us. These paradigms suggest that in the presence of warm (cold) eastern tropical Pacific and cold (warm) Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) lead to the increased likelihood of wetter (drier) conditions over the continental US including the SeUS. Juxtaposing this understanding with the fact that landfalling tropical cyclones contribute significantly to the annual mean total rainfall in the SeUS and in El Nio (La Nia) years with cold (warm) tropical Atlantic SSTA lead to reduced (increased) Atlantic tropical cyclone activity raises a conflict on the role of the large-scale SST variations in SeUS hydroclimate. This study attempts to investigate the apparent dichotomous role of the large scale SST variations on the SeUS hydrology by examining the role of rainfall from landfalling tropical cyclones in the SeUS to local seasonal droughts. Our study finds that the contribution of the rainfall from landfalling tropical cyclone on the mitigation of monthly drought in the 28 SeUS watersheds is relatively insignificant. So much so that the hydrological model uncertainty in estimating the drought index over the 28 SeUS watersheds is larger than the sensitivity exhibited by the drought index to the inclusion of rain from landfalling tropical cyclone. The conclusions of this study are justified by the fact that the timing of the landfalling tropical cyclone in relation to overall soil moisture conditions of the watershed does not coincide with a drought like situation in the 1948-2006 time period analyzed in this study. This largely stems from the fact that the large-scale flow pattern resulting in abundant (lack of) advection of moisture for anomalously wet (dry) summer and fall seasons in the SeUS emanating from the source region of the Caribbean Sea and the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean coincides with the steering flow of the Atlantic tropical cyclones bound to make landfall in the SeUS (recurving away from the SeUS).",

      "Abstract Note" : "Self-report measurements are ubiquitous in psychology, but they carry the potential of altering processes they are meant to measure. We assessed whether a common metamemory measure, judgments of learning, can change the ongoing process of memorizing and subsequent memory performance. Judgments of learning are a form of metamemory monitoring described as conscious reflection on one's own memory performance or encoding activities for the purpose of exerting strategic control over one's study and retrieval activities (T.O. Nelson & Narens, 1990). Much of the work examining the conscious monitoring of encoding relies heavily on a paradigm in which participants are asked to estimate the probability that they will recall a given item in a judgment of learning. In 5 experiments, we find effects of measuring judgments of learning on how people allocate their study time to difficult versus easy items, and on what they will recall. These results suggest that judgments of learning are partially constructed in response to the measurement question. The tendency of judgments of learning to alter performance places them in the company of other reactive verbal reporting methods, counseling researchers to consider incorporating control groups, creating alternative scales, and exploring other verbal reporting methods. Less directive methods of accessing participants' metacognition and other judgments should be considered as an alternative to response scales.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Introduction: In 2012, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) reaffirmed that domestic violence is a serious public health hazard that emergency medical services (EMS) personnel will encounter. Many victims of domestic violence may refuse transport to the hospital, making EMS pre-hospital field personnel -EMTs and paramedics- their only contact with healthcare providers. Despite these facts, the interaction of field EMS personnel and victims of domestic violence remains largely unexamined. Objectives: Given the importance of the interaction of field EMS personnel have with victims of domestic violence, the goal of this study is to explore attitudes about and experiences of EMS personnel on the issue of domestic violence after completing a training on domestic violence. Methods: Participants were recruited by researchers contacting multiple EMS agencies. Data were gathered using a survey attached to an online domestic violence training for field EMS personnel (EMTs and paramedics) circulated in a large southern state. Participants were able to obtain continuing education credits for completing the online modules. Results: A total of 403 respondents completed the survey. 71% of respondents indicated that they frequently encounter patients who disclose domestic violence; 45% believe that if a victim does not disclose abuse, there is little they can do to help; and from 32% to 43% reported assumptions and attitudes that indicate beliefs that victims are responsible for the abuse. Conclusions: Implications of the data are discussed suggesting that EMS providers are aware that they frequently assist victims of domestic violence, yet many continue to endorse common myths and negative attitudes about victims. Core components of training that can educate EMS personnel about the dynamics of domestic violence are described, and a new free online training for medical professionals on domestic violence is offered for use as part of ongoing education to enhance the EMS response to victims.

      "Abstract Note" : "We examined the equation of state and high-pressure elasticity of the hydrous aluminosilicate mineral topaz-OH (Al2SiO4(OH)(2)) using first principles simulation. Topaz-OH is a hydrous phase in the Al-2-O3SiO2-H2O (ASH) ternary system, which is relevant for the mineral phase relations in the hydrated sedimentary layer of subducting slabs. Based on recent neutron diffraction experiments, it is known that the protons in the topaz-OH exhibit positional disorder with half occupancy over two distinct crystallo-graphic sites. In order to adequately depict the proton environment in the topaz-OH, we examined five crystal structure models with distinct configuration for the protons in topaz-OH. Upon full geometry optimization we find two distinct space group, an orthorhombic Pbnm and a monoclinic P2(1)/c for topaz-OH. The topaz-OH with the monoclinic P2(1)/c space group has a lower energy compared to the orthorhombic Pbmn space group symmetry. The pressure-volume results for the monoclinic topaz-OH is well represented by a third order Birch-Murnaghan formulation, with V-0(mon) = 348.63 (+/- 0.04) angstrom(3), K-0(mon) = 164.7 (+/- 0.04) GPa, and K-0(mon) = 4.24 (+/- 0.05). The pressure-volume results for the orthorhombic topaz-OH is well represented by a third order Birch-Murnaghan formulation, with V-0(orth) = 352.47 (+/- 0.04) angstrom(3), K-0(orth) = 166.4 (+/- 0.06) GPa, and K-0(orth) = 4.03 (+/- 0.04). While the bulk moduli are very similar for both the monoclinic and orthorhombic topaz-OH, the shear elastic constants and the shear moduli are very sensitive to the position of the proton, orientation of the 0-H dipole, and the space group symmetry. The S-wave anisotropy for the orthorhombic and monoclinic topaz-OH are also quite distinct. In the hydrated sedimentary layer of subducting slabs, transformation of a mineral assemblage consisting of coesite (SiO2) and diaspore (AlOOH) to topaz-OH (Al2SiO4(OH)(2)) is likely to be accompanied by an increase in density, compressional velocity, and shear wave velocity. However, further studies of physical properties and lattice preferred orientation of several key hydrous aluminosilicates needs to be prioritized for gaining better insight into the transport of water via subduction of sediments.

      "Abstract Note" : "Methods to model snow aggregate scattering properties at microwave frequencies can be divided into structurally explicit and implicit techniques. Explicit techniques, such as the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), determine scattering and backscatter cross-sections assuming full knowledge of a given snow particle's structure. Such calculations are computationally expensive. Implicit techniques, such as using the T-matrix method (TMM) with optically soft spheroids, model equivalent particles with variable mass, bulk density and aspect ratio according to an effective-medium approximation. It is highly desirable that there should be a good agreement between modeled aggregate cross sections using both methods. A Voronoi bounding-neighbor algorithm is presented in this study to determine the bulk equivalent density of complex three-dimensional snow aggregates. While mass and aspect ratio are easily parameterized quantities, attempts to parameterize the bulk density of snowflakes have usually relied on a bounding ellipsoid, which can be determined from a flake's radius of gyration, root mean square mean or simply from its maximum diameter. We compared the Voronoi algorithm against existing bounding spheroid approaches and mass-effective density relations at ten frequencies from 10.65 to 183.31 GHz, using a set of 1005 aggregates with maximum dimensions from a few hundred microns to several centimeters. When using the Voronoi-determined effective density, the asymmetry parameter, scattering, and backscatter cross-sections determined using the TMM reasonably match those for DDA-computed snow aggregates. From K-u to W-band, soft spheroids can reproduce cross-sections for aggregates up to 9 mm in maximum dimension. Volume-integrated cross-sections always agree to within 25% of DDA. As the DDA is computationally expensive, this offers a fast alternative that efficiently evaluates scattering properties at microwave frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Major depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicide is fearsome; as such, the interpersonal theory of suicide proposes that individuals who engage in suicidal behavior possess not only the desire to die, but also the acquired capability (AC) for suicide. This study examined whether major depressive episodes (MDEs) may be particularly relevant to suicidal behavior when considered in the context of AC. History of MDEs, AC, and suicide attempt history were examined in a large (n = 3377) sample of military members. Data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. Results indicated that among individuals with high AC, the number of MDEs was significantly, positively associated with number of previous suicide attempts; MDEs were not significantly related to suicide attempt history among individuals with low AC. Findings held in the presence of robust covariates associated with suicidal behavior. Findings suggest that a history of MDEs alone may not indicate severe suicide risk-increased AC for suicide appears necessary for increased suicide risk. Implications for suicide treatment and prevention in military personnel are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Fear of negative evaluation has been documented as a mechanism that explains variations in feelings of belongingness. According to the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner 2005), feelings of thwarted belongingness, that one does not belong, can significantly increase desire and risk for suicide. We proposed that differences in thwarted belongingness may explain variations in suicidal ideation and behavior as a function of levels of fear of negative evaluation. This hypothesis was tested by examining self-reported fears of negative evaluation, thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation in 107 young adults, many who were explicitly targeted for recruitment due to a history of suicidal ideation and behavior [13.1 % had thoughts about suicide without a previous attempt; 15.9 % reported at least one previous attempt (max = 5 attempts)]. Mediation analyses were conducted with suicidal ideation entered as the outcome variable. Results indicated that greater fears of negative evaluation were significantly and positively associated with levels of suicidal ideation. Differences in thwarted belongingness fully accounted for the relationship between fears of negative evaluation and suicidal ideation. We conclude with clinical implications and future directions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are defined by chronic intrusive thoughts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between cognitive (attentional control) and motivational (negative urgency) mechanisms potentially underlying worry and obsessions. Participants (N = 526) completed an online questionnaire battery consisting of self-report measures of worry, OCD symptoms, attentional control (AC), negative urgency (NU), and trait negative affect. After controlling for trait negative affect, self-reported AC was negatively related to worry, repugnant obsessions, and ordering symptoms. Greater NU was associated with increased worry and repugnant obsessions. Further, self-reported AC and NU interacted such that greater NU was associated with greater worry at high but not low levels of AC. AC and NU were independently associated with repugnant obsessions. Perceived executive functioning impairments may confer risk for intrusive thoughts, particularly worries, whereas distress-driven impulsivity may contribute to the involuntary, ego-dystonic features of intrusions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Andrews (1999) has argued that under conditions of market-based liberalization, the sporting past has increasingly been put to use for the purposes of accumulation. This selectively rendered sporting historicism, he argues, results in a pseudo-authentic historical sensibility, as opposed to a genuinely historically grounded understanding of the past, or indeed the present by rendering history a vast, yet random, archive of events, styles, and icons (2006). Under such conditions, power-laden and selective mythscapes emerge. In this paper, we carry Andrews' contention forward by arguing that critical sport scholars should further problematize the uses of the sporting mythscapeparticularly by calling into question those re-historicizations that emerge in public discourse and excavating whose interests they serve. Here we interrogate the politics of how sporting pasts are mobilized in contemporary Aotearoa/New Zealand; in particular at the conjuncture of a globalized free-market economy and fluctuating (post-)colonial identity politics. We point to various cases that help reveal how specters of sporting pasts circulate within national mythologies in selective and politicized ways.",

Design: Case report. Setting/Participants: Twenty-seven NHs located in the Greater Rochester, NY area. Intervention: The learning collaborative approach in which interprofessional teams from different NHs work together to improve common clinical and organizational processes by sharing experiences and evidence-based practices to achieve measurable changes in resident outcomes and system efficiencies. Measurements: NH participation, curriculum design, LSS projects. Results: Over 6 years, 27 NHs from urban and rural settings joined the QILC as organizational members and sponsored 47 interprofessional teams to learn LSS techniques and tools, and to implement quality improvement projects. Conclusions: NHs, in both urban and rural settings, can benefit from participation in QILCs and are able to learn and apply LSS tools in their team-based quality improvement efforts.

      "Abstract Note" : "The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model 5-day simulations of Major Hurricane Julia (2010) and Tropical Storm Florence (2012), both of which developed from African easterly waves, are used to conduct a complete energetics study to explain why one storm became a major hurricane while the other weakened to a wave. The disparate intensity outcomes are caused by significant differences in the energetics of the two systems that emerge in their storm stages due to differences in the impact of the Saharan air layer (SAL). In their wave stages both waves exhibit a convectively driven energy production cycle, in which the regions of positive barotropic and baroclinic energy conversion and of diabatic heating and rainfall are all superimposed. Convection induces barotropic instability which then enhances the baroclinic overturning through a resonance of the two instabilities, which together produce the eddy kinetic energy. Diabatic heating in the convection generates eddy available potential energy which, along with the eddy kinetic energy, defines the total eddy energy of the system. Florence loses the convectively driven energy production cycle in the storm stage and begins to weaken, while Julia maintains this cycle and becomes a major hurricane. The disruption of the convection in Florence is due to the drying, stabilizing, and vertical shearing effects of an expansive SAL to the north of the storm, effects not present in the Julia case. Consideration is given to the different effects of the SAL on 6-10 day waves (Florence wave) versus 3-5 day waves (Julia wave).",

The present research tested the ingroup distancing effect, which predicts that Whites' negative reactions to low-SES ingroup members are motivated responses to perceived threats to their personal and group-level status. To cope with perceived status threats, White people psychologically and physically distance themselves from low-SES Whites. Four studies provide converging support for this theorizing. Among White participants, low-SES Whites elicited derogation, impaired racial categorization and memory, and inflated perceived personal status. White participants explicitly perceived low-SES Whites as greater status threats than low-SES Blacks, and these perceptions of threat predicted increased discomfort in anticipated social situations with low-SES White targets. Moreover, threatened status led Whites who strongly identified with their racial ingroup to physically distance themselves from a low-SES White partner. This research demonstrates that concerns with status motivate prejudice against ingroup members.",

This study evaluated whether children's Spanish early reading skills (i.e., print knowledge, phonological awareness, oral language) were related to their Spanish and English early writing skills using a sample of 554 children whose home language was Spanish. Multivariate regression analyses with simultaneous outcomes (Spanish and English invented spelling skills) were conducted to evaluate whether children's early reading and writing skills were related across languages. Results indicated that children's print knowledge and phonological awareness skills, but not oral language skills, were significantly related to their Spanish and English invented spelling skills. Spanish early literacy skills were not differentially related to Spanish and English reading and writing skills. The magnitude of the relations between print knowledge and oral language skills and children's invented spelling skills varied as a function of child age; however, the magnitude of the relation between phonological awareness and invented spelling skills did not differ as a function of child age. Furthermore, results suggested that language minority children's early reading and writing skills are related but distinct constructs and that children may be able to apply information gained from learning to read and write in their first language when learning to write in their second language.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Older adults die by suicide at a higher rate than any other age group in nearly every country globally. Suicide among older adults has been an intractable clinical and epidemiological problem for decades, due in part to an incomplete understanding of the causes of suicide, as well as imprecision in the prediction and prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in later life. Theory-driven investigations hold promise in addressing these gaps by systematically identifying testable, and thus falsifiable, mechanisms that may better explain this phenomenon and also point to specific interventions.Method: In this article, we comprehensively review key extant psychological and sociological theories of suicide and discuss each theory's applicability to the understanding and prevention of suicide among older adults.Results: Despite a modest number of theories of suicide, few have undergone extensive empirical investigation and scrutiny, and even fewer have been applied specifically to older adults.Conclusion: To advance the science and contribute findings with a measurable clinical and public health impact, future research in this area, from conceptual to applied, must draw from and integrate theory.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: Converging evidence suggests that the sequelae of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) including childhood abuse (e.g., sexual, physical, emotional/verbal abuse, neglect) and other ACE (e.g., family dysfunction, parental loss, parental psychopathology, substance abuse, incarceration, and domestic violence) have pronounced effects on suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation, attempts, and death by suicide) in older age. There are fundamental changes in the developmental trajectory of biological, psychological and behavioral processes that result from ACE and that exert influence throughout the life span. Different moderators and mediators may affect the extent and nature of the relationship. However, the literature on the specific mechanisms whereby ACE affects suicidality in later life has not been well identified.Method: We review and draw from extant multidisciplinary evidence to develop a heuristic framework through which to understand how ACE may lead to suicide in later life.Results: Proposed mechanisms span biological factors (neurological, gene-environment), psychiatric and health functioning, and psychosocial development (cognitive biases, coping resources, interpersonal deficits). Evidence suggests that ACEs affect each of these constructs, and it is likely in the interaction of these constructs with late-life stressors that suicidality in older adulthood emerges.Conclusion: ACEs have persistent and multifaceted effects on suicidality in late life. This association is due to multi-varied pathways. It is believed that the explanatory framework developed herein - in which biological, psychological and behavioral factors are organized, and the role of late-life stressors is highlighted - will spark further scientific inquiry into this important area.",

Examples are needed of how Research Domain Criteria constructs can be linked to clinical problems. We examined how two such constructs, threat sensitivity (THT+) and weak inhibitory control (INH-), operationalized using scale measures of fear/fearlessness and inhibition/disinhibition dimensions from established structural models, predicted symptoms of multiple Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) clinical disorders in 471 community adults. Robust relationships with internalizing disorder symptoms were evident for both trait variables, with THT+ more predictive of fear disorder symptoms and INH- more predictive of distress disorder symptoms. For substance-related problems, prediction was evident only for INH-. Additionally, interactive effects of THT+ and INH- were found for distress disorders, and to a lesser extent, fear disorders. Given their well-established physiological correlates, these dispositional variables represent prime targets for combined psychometric-neurophysiological assessment of broad liabilities to multiple forms of psychopathology.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The benefits of behavioral flexibility in social insect societies are well known, but the advantages of limited flexibility have seldom been considered. Florida harvester ant colonies maintain a stable forager population size for much of their active season, and despite seasonal variation in chronological age, foragers die within 27 days of initiating foraging. To determine how colonies balance forager mortality and forager replacement, we tested the relative influences of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on forager membership, retention, and longevity. Potential and realized forager longevity differed significantly. Residual lifespan increased by 57 % when colonies were penned for 20 days, and up to 8-fold when foragers were retained in the laboratory. Increased forager longevity inhibited the movement of new workers into the forager population. In contrast, increased mortality and starvation did not stimulate the addition of new foragers and forager population size declined when mortality exceeded 4 % per day. Experimental increases in forager number, body fat, and the ratio of larvae to foragers did not induce behavioral reversion in existing foragers. These results suggest an unidirectional allocation strategy, with foragers that are less disposable and less behaviorally flexible than the well-studied honey bee. In P. badius, forager membership is maintained not by young ants detecting increased demand, but by workers developing at rates that allow forager replacement and prevent excessive worker depletion. In the absence of a lifespan matched to predictable risks, opportunistic increases in forager survival may promote colony growth by inhibiting the scheduled and irreversible transitions of younger workers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Spaceflight-induced remodeling of the skull is characterized by greater bone volume, mineral density, and mineral content. To further investigate the effects of spaceflight on other non-weight bearing bones of the head, as well as to gain insight into potential factors mediating the remodeling of the skull, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of spaceflight on mandibular bone properties. Female C57BL/6 mice were flown 15 don the STS-131 Space Shuttle mission (n = 8) and 13 don the STS-135 mission (n = 5) or remained as ground controls (GC). Upon landing, mandibles were collected and analyzed via micro-computed tomography for tissue mineralization, bone volume (BV/TV), and distance from the cemento enamel junction to the alveolar crest (CEJ-AC). Mandibular mineralization was not different between spaceflight (SF) and GC mice for either the STS-131 or STS-135 missions. Mandibular BV/TV (combined cortical and trabecular bone) was lower in mandibles from SF mice on the STS-131 mission (80.7 +/- 0.8%) relative to that of GC (n = 8) animals (84.2 +/- 1.2%), whereas BV/TV from STS-135 mice was not different from GC animals (n = 7). The CEJ-AC distance was shorter in mandibles from STS-131 mice (0.217 +/- 0.004 mm) compared to GC animals (0.283 +/- 0.009 mm), indicating an anabolic (or anti-catabolic) effect of spaceflight, while CEJ-AC distance was similar between STS-135 and GC mice. These findings demonstrate that mandibular bones undergo skeletal changes during spaceflight and are susceptible to the effects of weightlessness. However, adaptation of the mandible to spaceflight is dissimilar to that of the cranium, at least in terms of changes in BV/TV. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Local governments forge informal and formal network ties with a variety of organizations, the most prominent of which are private, private/public development, community/residential, and public. Extant research has examined networks but not the processes of network partner choice and their networking. This research begins to fill these lacunas by empirically examining various explanations for economic development networks and their influence on each of these four types of networking. The findings reveal that the factors shaping network ties in each organization type are different. Except for community/residential organization network ties, local governments' networking is significantly related to the development incentives that they offer. Network ties with public organizations are related to government structures. Network ties with community/residential organizations are distinguished by their relationships with financial conditions and citizens' opposition to development. The factors influencing network activities for economic development with organizational types are shaped by the predisposition of each organizational network; thus, the factors promoting local economic development activities and the factors stimulating network activities for local economic development are different.",

Methods: We included 3138 individuals from SardiNIA project, none of whom was taking thyroid medication and antidepressants. Thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and antibodies against thyroperoxidase (TP0Ab) were measured in all the sample. Depressive symptoms were assessed with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: We found no association between TP0Ab and depressive symptoms and no linear association between TSH or FT4 levels and depressive symptoms. However, individuals in the lowest and highest FT4 quintiles showed a higher CES-D score compared to individuals in the middle quintile. In addition, participants in the lowest and highest FT4 quintiles had an increased risk of CES-D >= 16 with odds ratios of 1.44 (95% CI=1.09-1.89) and 1.33 (95% CI =1.01-1.77), respectively. Limitations: Cross-sectional design of the study. Conclusions: A U-shaped relation was found between FT4 and depressive symptoms: compared to average FT4 values, both high and low thyroid function was associated with more depressive symptoms. Further studies are necessary to determine the exact cause-effect relation of this association. (c) 2015 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Scholars and policy makers have expressed concern that observed minority differences in processing (e.g., arrest, detention, conviction) and sentencing stem not from the legal merits of cases but rather from intentional or unintentional discrimination. An additional concern is that there may be disparities in society that lead to offending differences among racial and ethnic groups, and that these differences may be amplified by disparities that minorities experience in and through the criminal justice system. In this article, we identify the dimensions along which information is needed to document minority disparities in criminal justice processing and sanctioning and to guide interventions to reduce them. We conclude that research to date has not systematically documented the true prevalence of minority disparities in criminal justice processing or sanctioning or the causes of them. We then argue that social structural disparities faced by minorities warrant comparable attention to that given to criminal justice disparities. Documentation of these disparities and their causes will be necessary to shed light on the exercise of formal social control. It also can contribute to efforts to understand offending and how most effectively to reduce crime and unfair sanctioning.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Charismatic rhetoric represents an important tool for leaders to articulate their respective visions. However, much of the research to date on this construct has yet to consider how the eight separate dimensions of charismatic rhetoric may be used in conjunction with one another to form distinctive profiles of charismatic leadership influence. Thus, the present investigation explored the interplay of the individual dimensions using content analysis of the 1960-2012 United States presidential debates. Cluster analysis revealed the emergence of four distinctive rhetorical strategies, one of which was more strongly related to the prediction of influence success as measured by presidential election outcomes. Results suggest that conceptualizing charismatic rhetoric as a multidimensional profile construct represents a valuable area for subsequent research on charismatic rhetoric, and several possible directions are suggested.

      "Abstract Note" : "The use of evidence-based practices in education has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. Researchers often use meta-analyses to identify evidence-based practices. To conduct meta-analyses of studies employing single-subject experimental research (SSER) designs for the purpose of identifying evidence base for a practice, a necessary step is to obtain raw data from published graphs. One method for obtaining raw data from published SSER graphs is the use of computer programs specifically designed to extract data from graphs. Purpose of the present study was to examine the reliability and validity of three data extraction programs, Ungraph, GraphClick, and DigitizeIt, using 60 graphs obtained from 15 SSER studies focused on a practice. Three coders extracted data from the graphs using the three programs. Values extracted by each coder were compared to (a) each other (reliability) and (b) values reported in the original articles in which the graphs were obtained from (validity). Results showed that raw data from SSER graphs can be obtained reliably using all three data extraction programs and values obtained using the three programs are highly valid. These results suggest that researchers can use data extracted using these programs with a high level of confidences while concluding meta-analyses of studies employing SSER designs. Authors make recommendations for improving the accuracy of data extraction using the three programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Although their implementation and use have the potential to touch nearly every aspect of the correctional system, the creation and examination of optimal development methods have been restricted to a small group of instrument developers. Furthermore, the methodological variation among common instruments used nationally is substantial. The current study examines this variation by reviewing methodologies used to develop several existing assessments and then tests a variety of design variations in an attempt to isolate and select those which provide improved content and predictive performance using a large sample (N = 44,010) of reentering offenders in Washington State. Study efforts were completed in an attempt to isolate and identify potential incremental performance achievements. Findings identify a methodology for improved prediction model performance and, in turn, describe the development and introduction of the Washington State Department of Correction's recidivism prediction instrumentthe Static Risk Offender Need Guide for Recidivism (STRONG-R).",

The model is examined in the context of seven nationally-recognized beer brands. As such, three theoretical contributions are made. First, the concept of CBD is revealed as useful in understanding consumers brand relationships. Second, CBI and CBD are evidenced as capturing an attraction/repulsion dynamic by which brands simultaneously attract and repulse segments of consumer. Third, the results suggest that the influence of self-motives, as represented by the symbolic drivers, differs for Gland CBD. Overall, the research suggests that capitalizing off of the symbolic properties of a brand is a difficult task as strong brand identities can alienate consumer segments. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: The transition to adulthood can be challenging, especially for children of incarcerated parents. Drawing on reentry and life-course scholarship, we argue that parental incarceration may adversely affect multiple life outcomes for children as they progress from adolescence into adulthood and that such effects may persist from early young adulthood into late young adulthood. Methods: The study uses propensity score matching analyses of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data (N = 12,844). Results: Analyses identified harmful effects of parental incarceration on many life domains, including criminal behavior, mental health, illegal drug use, education, earnings, and intimate relationships. These effects typically surfaced by early young adulthood and continued into late young adulthood. Conclusions: The results suggest that parental incarceration constitutes a significant turning point in the lives of young people and underscore the importance of life-course perspectives for understanding incarceration effects. They also illustrate that formal punishment policies may create harms that potentially offset intended benefits.",

      "Abstract Note" : "2D carbon fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites are prepared by PIP process using SiC and Ti3SiC2 as separate fillers. The effect of SiC and Ti3SiC2 fillers on mechanical property, fracture behavior and microstructure of the final composites is studied. The force-displacement curve shows no apparent delamination in C-f/Ti3SiC2-SiC composites during three-point flexural test, compared to C-f/SiC composites in which the through-thickness crack is much more devious. The ultimate force of C-f/Ti3SiC2-SiC composites is much lower than C-f/SiC composites. The thermal expansion mismatch and chemical reactions between carbon fiber and the matrix make the fiber-matrix interface bonding stronger in C-f/Ti3SiC2 SiC composites. It can infer that the carbon fibers' strength can be damaged by the chemical reactions. The thermal expansion mismatch and chemical reactions are two important factors that influence the mechanical properties and microstructure of the final composites.

      "Abstract Note" : "Cannabis use disorders (CUDs) co-occur with anxiety disorders at high rates, presumably because some individuals with anxiety disorders may rely on cannabis to manage anxiety. Motivation enhancement therapy (MET) combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for CUD, yet outcomes are worse for patients with elevated anxiety. The integration of MET-CBT with False Safety Behavior Elimination Treatment (FSET) may be useful with anxious CUD patients, as the use of cannabis to manage anxiety can be targeted as a false safety behavior. Here, we describe the integrated treatment and the successful use of it among two patientsone with CUD and comorbid social anxiety disorder (SAD) and one with CUD and comorbid SAD and generalized anxiety disorder. Data support the feasibility of this integrated treatment as a viable approach to the treatment of CUD and comorbid anxiety disorders. Future controlled trials are now warranted to further evaluate the intervention.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite well-established gender differences in the rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), there is a lack of research examining malleable, gender-linked risk factors that could be targeted in interventions to reduce risk among women. One such risk factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety related sensations. AS is elevated in women compared to men and is related to PTSD symptom severity. The current study provided a preliminary examination of whether AS could partially explain the association between gender and PTSD symptoms. Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial for elevated AS was used to explore this question in a sample of trauma-exposed individuals (N = 37; 22 with a current PTSD diagnosis). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation revealed that AS helped statistically explain the relationship between gender and PTSD symptoms. These results promote the potential importance of AS as a mechanism in the PTSD gender discrepancy. Future work should investigate these relationships longitudinally and establish whether targeting AS in a prevention paradigm could reduce the risk of PTSD development in women.

      "Abstract Note" : "There has been a significant amount of interest in understanding some of the key issues related to school suspensions and expulsions. One of the more intriguing and studied of these issues has to do with factors that contribute to variation in school disciplinary sanctions. To date, however, no research has examined the genetic architecture to either suspensions or expulsions. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing a sample of twin pairs drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The results of the analyses revealed that shared and nonshared environmental factors accounted for the variation in suspensions. Genetic influences, in contrast, were the dominant source of variation for expulsions. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and avenues for future research.

      "Abstract Note" : "Poor sleep quality is common among veterans, and associated with numerous negative consequences. Although sleep may play a critical role in next-day emotion regulation functioning, it is currently unclear how sleep quality relates to distress tolerance. As such, the current study cross-sectionally examined the association between sleep quality and distress tolerance (measured behaviorally and via self-report) among 94 military veterans with cannabis use disorder. Results indicated that Perceived Sleep Quality was associated with self-reported distress tolerance and increased frustration on a distressing task, after accounting for covariates. The current study's findings should be replicated utilizing prospective designs, but are initially consistent with theoretical models suggesting that sufficient sleep quality is necessary for appropriate affective functioning, and have clinical implications given the negative effects of poor sleep quality on general psychological functioning.

Participants included 1,185 college students who responded to a survey in class or online. Trends in responses suggested that experience and exposure to ASD were positively associated with sympathy and helping reactions given a simulated scenario that included challenging behavior. Conversely, experience and exposure to ASD were associated with lower anger, perceived controllability, and punitive reactions. Multiple regression analyses indicated that punitive intentions were largely predicted by feelings of anger toward the behaviors. Feelings of sympathy significantly contributed to reactions of wanting to help the child (vs. punishing).",

On uniform grids, these schemes are of Toeplitz structure which results in many advantages in developing fast linear solvers.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper focuses on one of the main challenges of 4-dimensional variational data assimilation, namely the requirement to have a forward solution available when solving the adjoint problem. The issue is addressed by considering the time in the same fashion as the space variables, reformulating the mathematical model in the entire space-time domain, and solving the problem on a near optimal computational mesh that automatically adapts to spatio-temporal structures of the solution. The compressed form of the solution eliminates the need to save or recompute data for every time slice as it is typically done in traditional time marching approaches to 4-dimensional variational data assimilation. The reduction of the required computational degrees of freedom is achieved using the compression properties of multi-dimensional second generation wavelets. The simultaneous space-time discretization of both the forward and the adjoint models makes it possible to solve both models either concurrently or sequentially. In addition, the grid adaptation reduces the amount of saved data to the strict minimum for a given a priori controlled accuracy of the solution. The proposed approach is demonstrated for the advection diffusion problem in two space-time dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We present an adaptive high-order accurate time-stepping numerical scheme for the flow of vesicles suspended in Stokesian fluids. Our scheme can be summarized as an approximate implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. Applying a fully-implicit SDC scheme to vesicle flows is prohibitively expensive. For this reason we introduce several approximations. Our scheme is based on a semi-implicit linearized low-order time stepping method. (Our discretization is spectrally accurate in space.) We expect that the accuracy can be arbitrary-order, but our examples suffer from order reduction which limits the observed accuracy to third-order. We also use invariant properties of vesicle flows, constant area and boundary length in two dimensions, to reduce the computational cost of error estimation for adaptive time stepping. We present results in two dimensions for single-vesicle flows, constricted geometry flows, converging flows, and flows in a Couette apparatus. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed scheme enables automatic selection of the time step size and high-order accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In this work, we use a general transformation to reduce the two-phase system of one spatial and time variable to a system of a single variable. Then we assess the behavior of solutions for the inviscid two-phase model with logistic growth. The growth rate widely impacts the behavior of the solution, producing either shocks or rarefactions. Increasing growth increases the frequency and spread of these waves, and eliminating growth reduces solutions to continuous traveling waves.

      "Abstract Note" : "In recent years, high protein food bars (HPFB) are a rapidly growing market. One major problem for commercial HPFB is that they become harder over time without moisture loss, making the product unacceptable to consumers. In this study, the effect of bovine casein and its hydrolysates on bar hardening during storage was studied. Five formulations of protein dough model systems were prepared from five commercial spray-dried dairy protein powders. According to our results, moisture migration should be the decisive factor of bar hardening in the moisture nonequilibrium systems during storage. Furthermore, disulfide-induced protein/peptide aggregation could also cause bar hardening. The substitution of a portion of whey protein isolates with either intact casein or hydrolyzed casein proteins could effectively reduce bar hardening during storage. In addition, the effect of the degree of hydrolysis on selected physicochemical properties (moisture sorption and glass transition) and bar hardening was also investigated.

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Animal models capable of differentiating the neurobiological intricacies between physical and emotional stress are scarce. Current models rely primarily on physical stressors (e.g., chronic unpredictable or mild stress, social defeat, learned helplessness), and neglect the impact of psychological stress alone. This is surprising given extensive evidence that a traumatic event needs not be directly experienced to produce enduring perturbations on an individual's health and psychological well-being. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a highly debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear of trauma-related stimuli, often occurs in individuals that have only witnessed a traumatic event. New method: By modifying the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm to include a witness component (witnessing the social defeat of another mouse), we demonstrate a novel behavioral paradigm capable of inducing a robust behavioral syndrome reminiscent of PTSD in emotionally stressed adult mice. Results: We describe the vicarious social defeat stress (VSDS) model that is capable of inducing a host of behavioral deficits that include social avoidance and other depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes in adult male mice. VSDS exposure induces weight loss and spike in serum corticosterone (CORT) levels. A month after stress, these mice retain the social avoidant phenotype and have an increased CORT response when exposed to subsequent stress. Comparison with existing method(s): The VSDS is a novel paradigm capable of inducing emotional stress by isolating physical stress/confrontation in mice. Conclusions: The VSDS model can be used to study the short- and long-term neurobiological consequences of exposure to emotional stress in mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: This study examined the impact of coping motives for cannabis and alcohol use on the relation between social anxiety/depressive symptoms and severity of substance use for alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis among treatment-seeking smokers who also use cannabis and alcohol. Methods: The sample included 197 daily cigarette smokers (M-Age 34.81years, SD = 13.43) who reported using cannabis and alcohol. Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted wherein separate models were constructed for each dependent variable. Among individuals with higher social anxiety, alcohol coping motives were associated with heavier drinking, and this was more pronounced among those low in depressive symptoms. Similarly, those at greater risk for nicotine dependence were anxious individuals with lower depressive symptoms who endorse coping-oriented motives for using cannabis. Further, among those with higher social anxiety, cannabis coping motives were associated with marginally greater drinking, particularly for those high in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The present findings support the perspective that among multisubstance users, the interplay between social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and coping-oriented motives for using one substance (e.g., cannabis or alcohol) may pose difficulties in refraining from other substances (e.g., tobacco). This observation highlights the importance of tailoring multisubstance treatments to specific needs of multiusers for whom single-substance interventions may be less effective. Findings also support previous work exploring the benefits of concurrently treating co-occurring substance use and lend credence to the perspective that motivation to use substances for coping reasons is of central theoretical and clinical relevance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Repair in composite materials is tending towards autonomic healing systems. This is a technological departure from the mechanical repair currently practiced in industry. For reinforced polymer matrix composites, failure tends to occur in the matrix or matrix-reinforcement interface. The most common failure mode is the formation and propagation of microcracks that reduce the material's structural capabilities. Damage may be fixed through traditional bolted or bonded repair methods, but such repair requires temporary decommission of a part, collection of repair materials, and employee time and effort to enact the repair. This review describes methods of self-repair and healing for polymeric materials with a focus on structural applications of these self-healing materials. From intrinsically healing polymers to self-healing-enabled polymer composites with dispersed agents or vascular networks, this review examines the chemistries and mechanisms which enable self-healing.

      "Abstract Note" : "In this study, the dynamic behavior of a concentrated solar power (CSP) supercritical CO2 cycle is studied under different seasonal conditions. The system analyzed is composed of a central receiver, hot and cold thermal energy storage units, a heat exchanger, a recuperator, and multi-stage compression-expansion subsystems with intercoolers and reheaters between compressors and turbines respectively. Energy models for each component of the system are developed in order to optimize operating and design parameters such as mass flow rate, intermediate pressures and the effective area of the recuperator to lead to maximum efficiency. The results show that the parametric optimization leads the system to a process efficiency of about 21% and a maximum power output around 1.6 MW. The thermal energy storage allows the system to operate for several hours after sunset. This operating time is approximately increased from 220 to 480 minutes after optimization. The hot and cold thermal energy storage also lessen the temperature fluctuations by providing smooth changes of temperatures at the turbine and compressor inlets. The results obtained in this paper indicate that concentrated solar systems using supercritical CO2 could be a viable alternative to satisfying energy needs in desert areas with scarce water and fossil fuel resources.

Regarding the cognitive aspect, we examined to what extent the cognitive processes underlying the scientific skills and the disciplinary reasoning behind the content knowledge were taught. Regarding the social aspect, we examined how classroom discourse supported student learning in terms of students' opportunities to talk and interaction patterns. Our participants were 17 physics teachers who were actively engaged in teacher education programs in universities and professional development programs in local school districts. We analyzed one lesson video from each participating teacher. The results suggest both promises and challenges. Regarding the cognitive aspect of inquiry, the teachers in general recognized the importance of teaching the cognitive processes and disciplinary reasoning. However, they were less likely to address common intuitive ideas about science concepts and principles. Regarding the social aspect of inquiry, the teachers frequently interacted with students in class. However, it appeared that facilitating conversations among students and prompting students to talk about their own ideas are challenging. We discuss the implications of these findings for teacher education programs and professional development programs in China.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study demonstrates how to increase the hardness, the mechanical strength, the ductility and the electrical conductivity of Cu-8 wt%Ag alloy by engineering the precipitation kinetics of Ag. Discontinuous and continuous precipitation phenomena were shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to correspond to two distinct exothermic reactions in this alloy. Activation energy was found to be 63.7 +/- 0.1 kJ/mol for discontinuous and 68.7 +/- 23 kJ/mol for continuous precipitation. At higher temperatures (475-580 degrees C), both continuous and discontinuous precipitation occurred, but at lower temperatures (410 degrees C), only discontinuous precipitation was observed. Because of higher density and very fine continuous precipitation, the microhardness and tensile strength of a sample aged at 475 degrees C was up to 22% higher than samples aged at other temperatures (e.g. 170 degrees C, 410 degrees C, 580 degrees C, and 680 degrees C). Optimized microstructure also enhances the ductility in addition to the tensile strength and the hardness. Because the formation of precipitation reduces Ag dissolved in Cu matrix, the electrical resistivity of aged samples began to decrease above 410 degrees C. The size, volume fraction, and spacing of continuous Ag precipitates apparently play important roles in maximization of total strength and electrical resistivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "At various developmental stages, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and their progeny secrete a large amount of extracellular matrices (ECMs) which could interact with regulatory growth factors to modulate stem cell lineage commitment. ECMs derived from PSC can be used as unique scaffolds that provide broad signaling capacities to mediate cellular differentiation. However, the rapid degradation of ECMs can impact their applications as the scaffolds for in vitro cell expansion and in vivo transplantation. To address this issue, this study investigated the effects of crosslinking on the ECMs derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the regulatory capacity of the crosslinked ECMs on the proliferation and differentiation of reseeded ESC -derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). To create different biological cues, undifferentiated aggregates, spontaneous embryoid bodies, and ESC-derived NPC aggregates were decellularized. The derived ECMs were crosslinked using genipin or glutaraldehyde to enhance the scaffold stability. ESC derived NPC aggregates were reseeded on different ECM scaffolds and differential cellular compositions of neural progenitors, neurons, and glial cells were observed. The results indicate that ESC -derived ECM scaffolds affect neural differentiation through intrinsic biological cues and biophysical properties. These scaffolds have potential for in vitro cell culture and in vivo tissue regeneration study. Statement of significance Dynamic interactions of acellular extracellular matrices and stem cells are critical for lineage-specific commitment and tissue regeneration. Understanding the synergistic effects of biochemical, biological, and biophysical properties of acellular matrices would facilitate scaffold design and the functional regulation of stem cells. The present study assessed the influence of crosslinked embryonic stem cell -derived extracellular matrix on neural differentiation and revealed the synergistic interactions of various matrix properties. While embryonic stem cell -derived matrices have been assessed as tissue engineering scaffolds, the impact of crosslinking on the embryonic stem cell -derived matrices to modulate neural differentiation has not been studied. The results from this study provide novel knowledge on the interface of embryonic stem cell -derived extracellular matrix and neural aggregates. The findings reported in this manuscript are significant for stem cell differentiation toward the applications in stem cell-based drug screening, disease modeling, and cell therapies.

      "Abstract Note" : "The structure of Cu-As-Te glasses is investigated using a combination of Cu-65 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy. A comparison of Cu-65 NMR spectra from a series of glasses and two reference crystalline phases CuInTe2 and CuGaTe2 reveals that Cu in all glasses invariably adopts a tetrahedral coordination with Te. This assignment is consistent with the presence of a sharp CuTe4 tetrahedral mode in all Cu-As-Te Raman spectra. The Raman spectra of Cu-As-Te and Ge-As-Te glasses of identical compositions suggest that the short range order of As and Te is the same in both systems. Te-125 NMR results corroborate this hypothesis. However, the breach in chemical order commonly observed in Ge-As-Te does not appear to occur in Cu-As-Te. The variation in glass transition temperature with composition shows identical trends for Cu-As-Te and Ge-As-Te glasses, however, the density trends for these two systems show dramatic differences. Such trends are partly controlled by the difference in chemical order in these telluride glasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Growing interest in developing more effective smoking cessation treatments has facilitated the need to further investigate cognitive-affective factors that inhibit successful smoking cessation, such as urges to smoke. Research has strongly supported an association between suicidality and smoking, yet no work has investigated whether suicidality may increase urges to smoke. The current study sought to evaluate the impact of suicidality on smoking-related cognitive-affective factors predictive of smoking relapse among a community sample of 209 daily smokers engaged in a smoking cessation program. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the effects of self-reported pre-cessation suicidality on urges to smoke 1 month post-cessation as well as whether this effect was mediated by greater barriers to cessation. Results indicated that internal barriers to cessation significantly mediated the effect of pre-cessation suicidality on greater urges to smoke 1 month following smoking cessation attempt. These findings suggest that elevated suicidality may affect perceived internal barriers to cessation and subsequently urges to smoke 1 month following a quit attempt. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Dispersion of low-density rigid particles with complex geometries is ubiquitous in both natural and industrial environments. We show that while explicit methods for coupling the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Newton's equations of motion are often sufficient to solve for the motion of cylindrical particles with low density ratios, for more complex particles - such as a body with a protrusion - they become unstable. We present an implicit formulation of the coupling between rigid body dynamics and fluid dynamics within the framework of the immersed boundary projection method. Similarly to previous work on this method, the resulting matrix equation in the present approach is solved using a block-LU decomposition. Each step of the block-LU decomposition is modified to incorporate the rigid body dynamics. We show that our method achieves second-order accuracy in space and first-order in time (third-order for practical settings), only with a small additional computational cost to the original method. Our implicit coupling yields stable solution for density ratios as low as 10(-4). We also consider the influence of fictitious fluid located inside the rigid bodies on the accuracy and stability of our method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Such methods provide tools for registering, deforming, comparing, averaging, and modeling anatomical shapes. In this work, we focus on the application of a recent method for statistical shape analysis of parameterized surfaces to simulation of endometrial tissue shapes. The clinical data contains magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) endometrial tissue surfaces, which are used to learn a generative shape model. We generate random tissue shapes from this model, and apply elastic semi-synthetic deformations to them. This provides two types of simulated data: (1) MM-type (without deformation) and (2) transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)-type, which undergo an additional deformation due to the transducer's pressure. The proposed models can be used for validation of automatic, multimodal image registration, which is a crucial step in diagnosing endornetriosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The system can be used for infiltration measurements in both single ring falling head and double ring constant head methods. The precise measurements of the current method compared to previous designed systems are not affected by sunlight, and due to the method of flow measurement, remain accurate even for low infiltration values. The set-up has an easy real-time data storage on a micro-SD card without a need of a portable computer in the field. It only requires a single reservoir for both inner and outer rings to which, water can be added anytime needed without affecting the measurements. The system automatically detects when the steady state infiltration rate is reached and concludes the testing and stops measurements. The system is mounted in a portable and weather resistant box and is applied to run DRI testing in the field to check the applicability and accuracy of the portable set-up in field measurements. Manual testing was also performed in the field for comparison with the automated system measurements. Overall system architecture, and the design of hardware and software components are presented in details. The system configuration is illustrated for better understanding of the set-up.

The behavior of the network under control by an external environment modeled by the Fitzhugh Nagumo (FN) is analyzed. Biologically, such a control system could mimic the modification of normal neuronal dynamics due to drugs or other chemical substances. We show that the environment could have as effect the suppression of chaos, enhancement of synchrony and favor interesting properties such as sub-threshold membrane oscillations, and oscillation death for relatively strong local coupling. Interestingly, we find that the electrical coupling between each two coupled HR and FN is less important to synchronization than the local coupling between the HR and the FN neurons. In other words, local interactions are found to play a stronger role in synchronization than long-range (global) interactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The data showed that teacher-centered collaborative activities to learn about mathematics teaching and learning (teacher collaboration and informal communication) seem to be more effective in improving student mathematics achievement than learning activities that do not necessarily involve such teacher-centered collaborative opportunities (professional development programs, university courses, individual learning activities). Teacher-driven research activities through professional conference presentation and participation were also found to be associated with student achievement growth in mathematics. The districts and schools may benefit from investing their professional development funds and resources in facilitating teacher-centered collaborative and research-based learning activities in order to improve student learning.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Using longitudinal data on undergraduates from 463 American colleges and universities from 1994-99, the authors examine how majoring in economics affects student opinions on 13 social, political, and economic issues. Economics majors were found to begin and end their college tenure with differing opinions on several issues when compared to other majors, and studying economics was found to be related to changes in several opinions. On the whole, studying economics appeared to increase beliefs in favor of personal freedom and decrease support for government intervention in markets. However, the authors find little evidence that economics majors leave college more united on their opinions when compared to the general student population.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) was designed for assessing a broad spectrum of externalizing problems, including impulsive-aggressive behavior and substance abuse. After translation of the ESI into Dutch, a computerized version of the full Dutch ESI (ESI-NL) was administered to a mixed sample consisting of inpatients in forensic and addiction care (n=99) and non-psychiatric community participants (n=104). Internal consistencies, test-retest reliabilities, predictive' validity of the full and 160-item ESI-NL total scores and subscales were examined, along with the correlations between these two versions. The results indicated high reliability and predictive validity for both versions and a strong similarity between the two in direct comparisons. The 160-item Dutch ESI is recommended for clinical studies on violence proneness and externalizing problem behavior.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The present study employed data simulation techniques to investigate the 1-year stability of alternative classification schemes for identifying children with reading disabilities. Classification schemes investigated include low performance, unexpected low performance, dual-discrepancy, and a rudimentary form of constellation model of reading disabilities that included multiple criteria. Data from a previously published study were used to construct a growth model of reading development. The parameters estimated from this model were then used to construct three simulated data sets wherein the growth parameters were manipulated in one of three ways: a stable-growth pattern, a mastery learning pattern, and a fan-spread pattern. Results indicated that overall the constellation model provided the most stable classifications across all conditions of the simulation, and that classification schemes were most stable in the fan-spread condition and were the least stable under the mastery learning growth pattern. These results also demonstrate the utility of data simulations in reading research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background and Objectives: Attentional control (AC) is defined as the ability to voluntarily shift and disengage attention and is thought to moderate the relationship between preexisting risk factors for fear and the actual experience of fear. Design: This longitudinal study elaborates on current models of AC by examining whether AC moderates or mediates effects of an ecologically valid stressor (a college examination) and also whether AC is predictive of state-like fear over longer timescales than previously reported. Methods: Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that AC would moderate the relationship between trait anxiety and affective distress in response to the examination stressor. We also tested a competing mediational model based on AC theory. These models were tested in two separate samples (sample 1, N = 219; sample 2, N = 129; Total N = 348) at two time points, at the beginning of a college semester in a large undergraduate class and 5 minutes prior to a college examination. Results: Mediation but not moderation of anxiety by AC was supported in both samples using multiple dependent measures. Conclusions: We conclude that AC may be useful in predicting affective distress in naturalistic settings, particularly in cases where anxiety is anticipatory.",

Results across two samples provided strong support for the hypothesized relationships. Specifically, employees who reported low levels of enactment behavior experienced less satisfaction, less person-environment fit, and reported lower levels of effort when faced with highly political environments. Conversely, levels of satisfaction and person-environment fit perceptions of individuals reporting high levels of enactment behaviors were largely unaffected by highly political contexts.

Methods: A secondary analysis of National College Health Assessment data gathered annually at one institution from 2004 to 2013 was utilized. A model predicting ED indicators was tested using logistic regression analyses with multiple categorical variables representing severity of sexual violence, accuracy of body weight perception, and an interaction between the two. Results: Sexual violence and inaccurate body weight perception significantly predicted ED indicators; sexual violence was the strongest predictor of purging behavior, whereas inaccurate body weight perception was best predicted by underweight status. Conclusions: Findings provide support to the relationship between purging behavior and severity of sexual violence and also to the link between inaccurate body weight perception and being underweight.",

Group A passages had a challenging readability level and high cohesion; Group B passages had an easier readability and low cohesion; Group C passages had a challenging readability level and low cohesion; and Group D passages had an easier readability and high cohesion. Students in Group D significantly outperformed students in Group C (g = 0.78).

      "Abstract Note" : "The African saw-wings (genus Psalidoprocne) are a group of swallows endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. Although currently described as five species with several subspecies, the taxonomy of the saw-wings is unclear. We sequenced two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and cytb; 1 717 sites) from 20 individuals in order to investigate phylogenetic relationships across the range of Psalidoprocne. We obtained similar results from maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian (BEAST) phylogenetic analyses, which reveal multiple well-supported mitochondrial clades in the genus. The geographic overlap of distinct lineages suggests reproductive isolation, although these clades do not correspond entirely to current species designations.",

Results on the frequency of victimization were mixed. In this sample, both frequency of physical abuse and frequency of sexual abuse significantly predicted current symptoms of psychosis, but only frequency of physical abuse significantly predicted substance misuse. Incarcerated women who experienced multivictimization were 5.7 times as likely to report depression, 4.2 times as likely to report current symptoms of psychosis, and 3.8 times as likely to meet criteria for a substance use disorder. Results indicate that adjusting prison-based interventions to address multivictimization may improve outcomes and reduce recidivism among this population.",

Researchers identified and analyzed the region's online-native sites, exploring their influence and \"alternativeness\"-in terms of ownership, funding, content, degree of activism, and organizational goals-and their \"digital-ness,\" in terms of the sites' inclusion of multimedia, interactive, and participatory digital features. In general, results show that the most influential online-native sites are attempting to renovate traditional, outdated modes of journalism, serving as alternatives to mainstream media and aiming to change society, even if the sites do not necessarily self-identify as \"alternative\" per se. Their emphasis on using innovative, digital techniques is important for re-conceptualizing not just the role of journalism in a digital era, but also journalism's relationship to alternative media and activism.",

Previous research confirms that humans are bad lie detectors, while demonstrating that certain observable linguistic features can provide crucial cues to detect deception. We designed and conducted an experiment that creates spontaneous deception scenarios in an interactive online game environment. Logistic regression, and certain classification methodologies were applied to analyzing data collected during fall 2014 through spring 2015. Our findings suggest that certain language-action cues (e.g., cognitive load, affective process, latency, and wordiness) reveal patterns of information behavior manifested by deceivers in spontaneous online communication. Moreover, computational approaches to analyzing these language-action cues can provide significant accuracy in detecting computer-mediated deception.",

      "Abstract Note" : "SmB6 has been predicted to be a strong topological Kondo insulator and experimentally it has been confirmed that at low temperatures the electrical conductivity only takes place at the surfaces of the crystal. Quantum oscillations and ARPES measurements revealed several Dirac cones on the (001) and (101) surfaces of the crystal. We considered four models for surface Dirac cones with an additional parabolic dispersion and studied their Landau quantization and the expectation value of the spin of the electrons. The Landau quantization is quite similar in all four cases and would give rise to similar de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. The spin-momentum locking, on the other hand, differs dramatically. Without the additional parabolic dispersion the spins are locked in the plane of the surface. The parabolic dispersion, however, produces a gradual canting of the spins out of the surface plane. The NMR Korringa relaxation and Knight shift of B nuclei in the topological Kondo insulator SmB6 are discussed and we explore the possibility of microwave transitions among the surface states.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - Despite recent calls in the hospitality and tourism literature for increased research attention in the attractions industry, very little research exists in this important part of the hospitality marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to address the dearth of research in this domain by proposing and empirically testing a model of the relationships among image, price fairness and loyalty in the waterpark segment of the attractions industry. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 346 waterpark patrons in South Korea. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results provide empirical support for the proposed relationship between waterpark image and customer loyalty. Additionally, a set of indirect relationships between these two constructs was identified. Specifically, the intervening effects of delight, service quality and price fairness were established. Research limitations/implications - While the overall premise of the work was supported, the results provide evidence that price fairness is evaluated and considered differently in an amusement park context than in other consumption domains. This research suggests that future efforts are necessary to fully understand the complexities of behavior in the attractions industry. Practical implications - The findings suggest that successful image management results in a variety of positive outcomes including quality/price perceptions and customer loyalty. To stay competitive, however, waterparks must engage in an ongoing process of image development and maintenance with a particular emphasis on managing expectations. Originality/value - The research suggests that while the traditionally acknowledged effects of image on consumer behavior have applicability within the attractions industry, some of the existing nomological relationships established in other operational domains may not be generalizable. As such, our research can be seen as a step toward the development of a unique theory of behavior in the attractions industry.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - This study aims to examine previously identified hotel automated valuation models (AVMs) using a more extensive and updated sample of hotel sale transaction data, introduce economic conditions as a new determinant for hotel market value and test the moderating role of economic conditions on the relationship between the previously identified indicators and market value, operationalized as sale transaction price. Design/methodology/approach - This study performs simple and multiple regression analyses to examine the proposed relationships. The sample period is from 2000 to 2012, because the economy prior to 2000 is likely to have been a less-relevant economic environment for the contemporary business world. Findings - As hypothesized, there is an insignificant main effect of economic conditions on hotel sale prices. Amoderating role of economic conditions on the relationship between average daily rate (and net operating income) and market value was found, while no moderating effect was found for occupancy rate and hotel size. Results also find certain support for AVMs previously presented in the literature, as described herein. Originality/value - This study attempts to make contributions to the existing lodging and real estate literature by investigating a main effect of economic conditions on hotel sale prices and a moderating role of economic conditions on the relationship between various hotel performance indicators and hotel sale prices. In addition, this study operationalizes a relatively extensive (large base sample size of 2,441 hotel sale transactions) and recent (since 2000) database compared to previous studies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Some prior research has found that religiosity and spirituality can be related to health. However, the relationships are inconsistent, measures of religiosity and spirituality are often problematic and conflated with the health outcomes they are supposed to predict, and very little research on this topic specifies which aspects of health supposedly benefit from religiosity and spirituality. Using two sets of survey data (Sample 1 N=347; Sample 2 N=404), we examined whether religiosity and spirituality had direct or indirect effects on physical, mental, and/or social health. We found that spirituality, when conceptualized as belief and experience of the supernatural, had no direct or indirect effect on physical, mental, or social health. Religiosity had a small but significant direct effect on social health in one sample but not the other. We consider our findings in relation to religious privileging in the United States and how proreligious biases can lead to health inequalities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "State regulators in Florida recently approved a first-of-its-kind probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for determining an alternative residential Soil Cleanup Target Level (SCTL) for dioxin (32ng/kg TEQ). The default residential SCTL (7ng/kg TEQ) is based on a single, deterministic calculation with numerous conservative assumptions, resulting in an overly conservative value far beyond the regulatory mandate (i.e., 10(-6) increase in cancer risk). Conversely, this PRA used a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate risk for all members of a large population using a combination of scientific data and professional judgment, with final details developed during negotiations with regulators. The simulation parameters were defined probabilistically and reflect the ranges of values for the following exposure variables: body weight, exposure duration, exposure frequency, fraction from contaminated source, soil ingestion rate, and relative bioavailability. Other variable and uncertain parameters were treated deterministically per direction from the regulators. The state also required that a pre-supposed high-risk subpopulation be analyzed separate from the full receptor population. Despite the conservativeness of the alternative SCTL, this PRA represents a significant step toward more realistic estimates of human health risks caused by environmental contaminant exposure.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: Wartime combat exposure is linked to a broad array of negative outcomes. The current study identified potential differences between middle-to-older aged men exposed to combat and those not exposed for physical health, interpersonal, and economic functioning over 10 years. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social support were examined as moderators between combat exposure and outcomes.Methods: Data from the National Comorbidity Survey, baseline and 10-year follow-up, were utilized. Only men aged 50-65 at follow-up (N = 727) were included. Group differences between combat and non-combat men were examined. Regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between earlier combat and health, interpersonal, and economic outcomes over time, while controlling for important covariates.Results: Combat-exposed men were at increased risk for asthma, arthritis/rheumatism, lung diseases, headaches, and pain; they also had greater marital instability. However, combat-exposed men reported economic advantages, including higher personal earnings at follow-up. For combat-exposed men, PTSD did not increase risk for headaches; however, PTSD in non-combat men was associated with increased risk for headaches at follow-up. Whereas combat-exposed men with higher levels of social support were less likely to report chronic pain at follow-up, there were no group differences in pain at lower levels of social support.Implications: Individuals who experience combat may be susceptible to later health and marital problems; however, as combat-exposed men age, they demonstrate some resilience, including in economic domains of life. Given that consequences of combat may manifest years after initial exposure, knowledge of combat exposure is necessary to inform treatments and the delivery of disability benefits.",

In addition, this study examines the moderating role of knowledge in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach - The researchers collected data via online surveys to reach the target population of this study, 55 years and older adults who had used mobile devices for tourism. The researchers used the partial least squares approach for this study. Findings - The results reveal that ease of use has significant effects on extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The motivations of usefulness and enjoyment significantly affect attachment, which, in turn, influences usage intention. The relationships between ease of use and usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment and enjoyment and attachment were stronger for the high-knowledge group than for the low-knowledge group. The relationship between usefulness and attachment was stronger for the low-knowledge group than for the high-knowledge group. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study provide compelling implications for academics and practitioners in the senior tourism field. Originality/value - The compelling insight of this study is the development of a research model that combines an emergent construct of attachment as a mediator and knowledge of technology as a moderator.",

All students from three semesters of F2F (n = 74) and online (n = 78) sections of an MSW clinical class taught by the same instructor were included. Two assignments were used to compare students: an assessment and treatment plan of a fictional case and a digital role-play. A doctoral student who was blinded to the course delivery mechanism graded the role-play. After controlling for baseline differences in age, there were no differences between online and F2F students in skill demonstration. It appears clinical skills can be taught as effectively online as in F2F situations based on blinded review of role-plays.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the scores of Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Cynicism (CY) and Professional Efficacy (PE) of staff members according to occupational variables in two correctional facilities (CF1 and CF2). METHODS: 339 Brazilian employees from two correctional facilities completed a socio-demographic/occupational questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS). The comparison between the scores obtained on each MBI-GS factor, according to variables of interest vs. correctional facilities, was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA-two way: p < 0.05). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between the levels of EE, CY and PE between the correctional facilities (p < 0.001); staff from CF2 presented worse levels. Women (p = 0.014) and individuals with a 10-year tenure or higher (p = 0.041) presented higher levels of EE. Lower scores of professional efficacy were found in CF2 staff members with a 10-year tenure or higher (p = 0.018). The prison escort and surveillance agents presented mean values of EE (p = 0.030) and CY (p = 0.008) that were significantly lower than those of the correctional security officers. CONCLUSIONS: The scores of EE, CY and PE of the staff members suffered a significant influence from the correctional facility, gender, professional category and tenure.",

In order to fill this important gap in the literature, the purpose of this study is to examine the perception of restaurant innovativeness and the effect of this construct on relationship quality. Based on a review of the literature, a conceptual model was developed hypothesizing the effects of the overall image of restaurant innovation on three determinant attributes of relationship quality: trust, commitment, and satisfaction. The model was then tested using data collected from 398 luxury restaurant patrons. The results of data indicate that the overall image of restaurant innovativeness is positively related to relationship quality in the luxury restaurant setting. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are considered.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The present study used a randomized control trial to examine the effects of a widely used multicomponent Tier 2-type intervention, Passport to Literacy, on the reading ability of 221 fourth graders who initially scored at or below the 30th percentile in reading comprehension. Intervention was provided by research staff to groups of 4-7 students for 30min, 4days a week throughout the school year (M = 90.45 lessons). Tier 1 instruction was observed to be of generally high quality and intervention fidelity was strong. Findings revealed small, average effects (ES = .14-.28) in favor of intervention students on standardized measures of comprehension, but no effects on word reading or fluency measures. Exploratory analyses indicated that intervention effects may differ by students' comprehension abilities. Implications for intervention implementation and directions for future research are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In 2014, two groups of scientists published open letters on the efficacy of brain-training interventions, or \"brain games,\" for improving cognition. The first letter, a consensus statement from an international group of more than 70 scientists, claimed that brain games do not provide a scientifically grounded way to improve cognitive functioning or to stave off cognitive decline. Several months later, an international group of 133 scientists and practitioners countered that the literature is replete with demonstrations of the benefits of brain training for a wide variety of cognitive and everyday activities. How could two teams of scientists examine the same literature and come to conflicting \"consensus\" views about the effectiveness of brain training? In part, the disagreement might result from different standards used when evaluating the evidence. To date, the field has lacked a comprehensive review of the brain-training literature, one that examines both the quantity and the quality of the evidence according to a well-defined set of best practices. This article provides such a review, focusing exclusively on the use of cognitive tasks or games as a means to enhance performance on other tasks. We specify and justify a set of best practices for such brain-training interventions and then use those standards to evaluate all of the published peer-reviewed intervention studies cited on the websites of leading brain-training companies listed on Cognitive Training Data (www.cognitivetrainingdata.org), the site hosting the open letter from brain-training proponents. These citations presumably represent the evidence that best supports the claims of effectiveness. Based on this examination, we find extensive evidence that brain-training interventions improve performance on the trained tasks, less evidence that such interventions improve performance on closely related tasks, and little evidence that training enhances performance on distantly related tasks or that training improves everyday cognitive performance. We also find that many of the published intervention studies had major shortcomings in design or analysis that preclude definitive conclusions about the efficacy of training, and that none of the cited studies conformed to all of the best practices we identify as essential to drawing clear conclusions about the benefits of brain training for everyday activities. We conclude with detailed recommendations for scientists, funding agencies, and policymakers that, if adopted, would lead to better evidence regarding the efficacy of brain-training interventions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Rose rosette virus (RRV), a negative-strand RNA virus belonging to the genus Emaravirus, has recently been characterized to be the causal agent of rose rosette disease. Roses showing typical symptoms of RRV collected from a rose nursery in Florida were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay using primers corresponding to the conserved inverted 13 nucleotide long stretches found at the termini of the RRV genomic RNA segments. RT-PCR analysis yielded two novel genomic RNA segments, RNA5 and RNA6, in addition to the previously identified four RNA segments. The RNA5 is 1650 bp long and encodes for a polypeptide of 465 amino acids (54.3 K), while RNA6 is 1400 bp long and encodes for a polypeptide of 233 amino acids (27.05 K). RACE analysis showed that, both the RNA segments posses at their 5' and 3' termini, stretches of conserved inverted complementary13 nucleotides long sequence with two nucleotide mismatches as previously identified in other genomic RNA segments. Northern blot analysis as well as RT-PCR using specific primers showed the presence of the novel genomic RNA segments in infected plants, but absent in the non-infected plants. The GenBank Acc. Nos. for the sequences reported in this paper are KT007556 and KT007557.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In Sierra Leone, as in conflict and postconflict settings around the world, youth are coping with their exposure to violence during conflict as well as the poverty and displacement that follow war and the stigma that can persist long after involvement with armed groups has ended. Both contextual and individual factors influence whether youth overcome these barriers successfully and resume positive life trajectories, or struggle to reintegrate into their families and communities. This study reviews findings from the 14-year Longitudinal Study of War-Affected Youth in Sierra Leone and a recent intervention study examining a short-term group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention for war-affected youth, and discusses the implications of the impact of interventions for understanding and promoting resilience in war-affected youth. The results suggest that group CBT approaches may be a cost-effective means of targeting support to youth most in need of psychosocial support in postconflict settings. (C) 2016 S.

      "Abstract Note" : "This article evaluates the interdependence of medical malpractice insurance markets and health insurance markets. Prior research has addressed the performance of these markets, individually, without specifically quantifying the extent to which they are linked. Increasing levels of health insurance losses could increase the scale of potential malpractice claims, boosting medical malpractice losses, or could embody an improvement in medical care quality, which will reduce malpractice losses. Our results for a state panel data set from 2002 to 2009 demonstrate that health insurance losses are negatively related to medical malpractice insurance losses. An additional dollar of health insurance losses is associated with a $0.01-$0.05 reduction in medical malpractice losses. These findings have potentially important implications for assessments of the net cost of health insurance policies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Lineage specification of both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is accompanied by spatial consolidation of chromosome domains and temporal consolidation of their replication timing. Replication timing and chromatin organization are both established during G1 phase at the timing decision point (TDP). Here, we have developed live cell imaging tools to track spatio-temporal replication domain consolidation during differentiation. First, we demonstrate that the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (Fucci) system is incapable of demarcating G1/S or G2/M cell cycle transitions. Instead, we employ a combination of fluorescent PCNA to monitor S phase progression, cytokinesis to demarcate mitosis, and fluorescent nucleotides to label early and late replication foci and track their 3D organization into sub-nuclear chromatin compartments throughout all cell cycle transitions. We find that, as human PSCs differentiate, the length of S phase devoted to replication of spatially clustered replication foci increases, coincident with global compartmentalization of domains into temporally clustered blocks of chromatin. Importantly, re-localization and anchorage of domains was completed prior to the onset of S phase, even in the context of an abbreviated PSC G1 phase. This approach can also be employed to investigate cell fate transitions in single PSCs, which could be seen to differentiate preferentially from G1 phase. Together, our results establish real-time, live-cell imaging methods for tracking cell cycle transitions during human PSC differentiation that can be applied to study chromosome domain consolidation and other aspects of lineage specification.",

As a result, studies have begun to investigate the factors involved in the development of self-control. The current study builds on this body of research and examines the extent to which neuropsychological functioning and adversity influence the development of self-control from kindergarten to the end of fifth grade. Utilizing data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), findings from the cross-sectional analysis revealed neuropsychological functioning to be significantly associated with the development of self-control, net of the presence of home, school, and environmental adversity. The longitudinal analysis revealed similar findings; however, home adversity surfaced as the most salient predictor of self-control during late childhood. Together, these findings highlight the importance of individual and environmental factors in the creation of children's self-control.",

The analysis revealed that there were 5 factor predictors according to the items in each factor: parental attachment, parental stress, parental monitoring, career recommendation, and career discrepancy. Parent-child relationship and career goal tension factors were partially associated with delinquent behaviors for Korean youth. Moreover, those relationships were partially moderated by gender.",

There is only one AIDS service organization and only one Ryan White Program-supported HIV/AIDS medical care provider in the region. Improvement in HRQOL is a treatment goal set by the Ryan White Program and is a common goal of HIV case management. Results indicate mild symptom burden, mild functional impairment, and poor HRQOL.

      "Abstract Note" : "Lifestyle and routine activity theories both view victimization through the lens of the convergence of a motivated offender, an attractive target/victim, and the absence of capable guardianship. These theories differ, however, in how they view the behaviors that put people at \"risk\" for victimization. Where lifestyle theory conceives of risk in probabilistic terms (e.g., certain behaviors elevate one's odds of being victimized), routine activity theory simply describes the victimization event itself (e.g., if the three key elements converge, victimization happens, yet if one of the elements is missing, victimization is avoided). We argue that this difference is meaningful and that its disappearance over time has been consequential to the study of victimization. Our purpose here is to outline the implications of this difference in the conception of risk for victimization theory, research, and policy. Our broader goal is to reignite a theoretical debate that we feel is long overdue.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Unmotivated test takers using rapid guessing in item responses can affect validity studies and teacher and institution performance evaluation negatively, making it critical to identify these test takers. The authors propose a new nonparametric method for finding response-time thresholds for flagging item responses that result from rapid-guessing behavior. Using data from a low-stakes assessment of college-level academic skills as an illustration, the authors evaluate and compare model fit and score estimation based on data sets cleaned by both new and existing methods. Flagging rapid-guessing responses is found to generally improve model fit, item parameter estimation, and score estimation, as in the literature. This new method, based on both response time and response accuracy, shows promise in detecting rapid guessing and in improving efficiency of the flagging process when built into data analysis.",

This study investigated, from students' perspectives, the contributors to stress, nature of stress, coping strategies used, and role of drugs and alcohol during stressful periods-all with particular relevance for suicidality. Undergraduate and graduate students were sampled on an online survey from 73 institutions, totaling 26,292 respondents. The pervasiveness of stressful experiences students endorse appears to be more than traditional clinical interventions can manage on their own. Recommendations are, therefore, made about how to utilize population-based prevention to reduce students' distress and suicidality and improve their mental health.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - The practice of an interscholastic athletic department reproducing the logo of a collegiate team for its own use is becoming increasingly visible. In response to this growth, many collegiate licensing departments have begun actively enforcing zero-tolerance policies that prohibit third parties from using their respective colleges' trademarks. Conversely, other institutions have exercised discretion by allowing high school programs to use their athletic departments' logos only after receiving assurances from the high school that it will adhere to strict usage guidelines. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a thorough discussion on the concept of brand dilution and its application to sport. More specifically the study gives an account of the strategies employed by trademark specialists to protect (and in some cases, enhance) the equity of their brands. To identify these strategies, a qualitative questionnaire was employed, which was completed by 13 brand managers representing institutions from the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12 Conference, Big Ten Conference, Mid-American Conference, Missouri Valley Conference, Pac-12 Conference, and the Southeastern Conference. Findings - Qualitative questionnaire responses from collegiate brand managers suggest that licensing departments differ in their perceptions of the outcomes associated with allowing logo replication in high school athletic departments. Originality/value - Perceived consequences of two enforcement strategies - prohibitive and cooperative - are highlighted, as are implications and directions for future research.",

European American race, Hispanic/Latino race (individual), and family satisfaction (family context) were all significantly associated with less face-to-face victimization only, and school pressure (school context) was significantly associated with more face-to-face bullying. Peer groups accepted by parents (family context) were related to less cyberbullying victimization, and calling/texting friends were related to more cyberbullying victimization.

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - According to convergence theory, over time societies form similar social structures, political processes and public policies. In 2001, Israel adopted a welfare reform plan that rejected the traditional strategy of passive income support and instead endorsed the concept of activation. The plan was modeled on the Wisconsin Welfare to Work program and was designed to put the long-term unemployed to work. The program began operating in four regions in 2004 but was abruptly terminated six years later. The purpose of this paper is to analyze why Israel's welfare reform failed to follow the smooth path predicted by convergence theory and elucidates the factors in the Israeli environment that made the implementation of a program borrowed from the USA unsustainable. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-method approach including interviews with key informants, content analysis of media materials and government documents and a quantitative comparative values analysis of four nations. Findings - The failure of US-style welfare reform in Israel was due to four main factors: a more diverse recipient population, a lack of understanding of Israeli cultural values, a welfare population that included a substantial number of ethnic minorities whose customs conflicted with program regulations and a social movement against the program by non-profit organizations. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates the limitations of convergence theory and highlights the salience of cultural values in the transmission of activation policies across nations. Specifically, it shows that outcomes vary when policies that are superficially similar are implanted in nations with fundamentally different cultures.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite the clinically-significant association between perceived stress and smoking, there is little understanding of the mechanisms underlying this relation. The present study examined smoking-specific experiential avoidance as an explanatory mechanism linking perceived stress and smoking, including nicotine dependence, perceived barriers to cessation, and problems reported during past quit attempts among treatment-seeking daily smokers (n=365; 48.5% female; M-age=38.02; SD=13.10). Results indicated that smoking-specific experiential avoidance had a significant, indirect effect on perceived stress and the studied smoking criterion variables. The present findings provide initial empirical support that smoking-specific experiential avoidance may help explain how perceived stress is associated with smoking. These data suggest that there may be merit to targeting smoking-specific experiential avoidance during smoking cessation among smokers with elevated perceived stress.

      "Abstract Note" : "Commitment uncertainty represents an ongoing state of conflicted feelings or thoughts about the future of a relationship. It is currently an underexplored dynamic within romantic relationships and may be a key component of young adult relationships that may influence the likelihood of relationship termination. When commitment is uncertain, individuals may engage in serious monitoring of relationship alternatives. The authors examined the associations between commitment uncertainty, serious alternative monitoring, attachment style, and relationship termination. Results supported the hypothesis that higher levels of commitment uncertainty are related to greater likelihood of termination. Interestingly, serious monitoring of alternatives was not related to relationship termination. Implications are offered for the management of these important relational processes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Risk assessments have been used in the juvenile justice system to predict future crime, identify youth needs, and inform case planning. Currently, the literature shows that juveniles are most often assessed when they enter court jurisdiction and this entry or initial risk assessment score is typically used to predict recidivism. The current study used the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory to examine the predictive validity of initial, exit, and change in risk scores on a diverse sample (N = 360) of young probationers. This study is one of few attempts to determine the predictive accuracy of change in risk, and the first to investigate the comparative validity of initial and exit risk scores with a sample of young offenders. Exit and change in risk scores significantly predicted recidivism 1-year post probation, yet initial scores did not. Differential predictive validity across race and gender was not identified for the initial or exit risk scores. The importance of examining changes in risk over time was discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Internet pornography is a multi-billion-dollar industry that has grown increasingly accessible. Delay discounting involves devaluing larger, later rewards in favor of smaller, more immediate rewards. The constant novelty and primacy of sexual stimuli as particularly strong natural rewards make Internet pornography a unique activator of the brain's reward system, thereby having implications for decision-making processes. Based on theoretical studies of evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics, two studies tested the hypothesis that consuming Internet pornography would relate to higher rates of delay discounting. Study 1 used a longitudinal design. Participants completed a pornography use questionnaire and a delay discounting task at Time 1 and then again four weeks later. Participants reporting higher initial pornography use demonstrated a higher delay discounting rate at Time 2, controlling for initial delay discounting. Study 2 tested for causality with an experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to abstain from either their favorite food or pornography for three weeks. Participants who abstained from pornography use demonstrated lower delay discounting than participants who abstained from their favorite food. The finding suggests that Internet pornography is a sexual reward that contributes to delay discounting differently than other natural rewards. Theoretical and clinical implications of these studies are highlighted.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study investigated whether the effects of viewing pro-environmental messages within a narrative context affected intention to perform ecofriendly behaviors through the accessibility of participants' (N = 332) environmental attitudes. One week after an online pretest, participants viewed one of two television clips that either included or did not include pro-environmental messages. Participants then completed attitude accessibility latency measures and reported behavioral intent to perform several ecofriendly behaviors. Reinforcement of pro-environmental attitudes by the pro-environmental messages occurred through the accessibility of the attitudes, which, in turn, predicted intention to engage in the depicted ecofriendly behaviors. Consistent with a category activation hypothesis, accessible attitudes toward the specific behaviors depicted in the program predicted the accessibility of attitudes toward ecofriendly behaviors that were not depicted or explicitly discussed in the program, and these accessible attitudes predicted intention to engage in ecological behaviors not depicted in the program. These findings are a first demonstration that portrayals of specific behaviors in a narrative television program can increase behavioral intention for related behaviors not shown in the program and that these effects occur through the activation of existing, positive attitudes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "It is common knowledge that mixture models are prone to arrive at locally optimal solutions. Typically, researchers are directed to utilize several random initializations to ensure that the resulting solution is adequate. However, it is unknown what factors contribute to a large number of local optima and whether these coincide with the factors that reduce the accuracy of a mixture model. A real-data illustration and a series of simulations are presented that examine the effect of a variety of data structures on the propensity of local optima and the classification quality of the resulting solution. We show that there is a moderately strong relationship between a solution that has a high proportion of local optima and one that is poorly classified.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the topic of multi-channel retailing. Specifically, the research intends to determine if and to what extent the opening of physical stores by a former web-only retailer reduces or extends overall retail sales, and whether such effects tend to change over time. Empirical analysis focuses on data elaboration from a retailer who has passed from the initial mono-channel model (pure online), to a multi-channel one with the opening of stores. Design/methodology/approach - Through the analysis of an internal data set of a leading consumer electronics retailer applying Probit and Logit estimation techniques, the authors extract information about actual customers' purchases (or rather retail sales) in three newly opened stores and about online purchases (through an e-commerce web site managed by the same retailer with the same store brand) by people living in the new store service areas before and after the openings. Findings - The paper shows that, for the single customer, the probability of purchasing online is reduced by the store opening in the short term, but tends to increase in the long term. Besides, results indicate that long-term synergy between the two channels depends mainly on indirect influence due to the mere presence of the store brand in the area rather than on the direct experience of shopping in the store. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights that channel portfolio enlargement from mono-to multi-channel retailing tends to activate a sort of life cycle; while in the early phase of store addition web sales tend to be cannibalized because the two channels are perceived as \"substitutes\" for each other, in the long run migration turns into a synergy effect; different channels tend to interact with and reinforce each other as customer touch points of the same retailer, in an omni-channel perspective. Originality/value - The paper herein presents various original elements concerning types of available data (actual sales rather than consumers' intentions/perceptions and individual level data rather than aggregate level ones), estimation technique used (binary choice model) and research hypotheses (distinguishing between \"direct\" and \"indirect\" synergy effects in multi-channel retailing).",

      "Abstract Note" : "This article outlines the pressures on young gnawa musicians embarking on a career in contemporary Morocco. The influences of the popular music industry provide new options for those looking to learn and advance. They can choose to engage the traditional system of apprenticeship or navigate their career outside it. This article outlines the pathway and expectations built into an apprenticeship-based mode of learning and becoming gnawa. It then moves to explore the opportunities and pressures that affect those who chose to sidestep the established system. Young performers who do so adeptly respond to their audiences' desires and can find success, though they may measure it differently. Even so, however, they struggle for respect from the larger gnawa community. I examine how these artists strategise their careers between traditional and novel educational systems. They prioritise skills that are important to their movement through the popular music industry. This does not preclude opportunities for ritual performance, though it does affect how and where they find work. While some fail due to a poor knowledge of repertoire or a lack of experience, others utilise a nuanced understanding of their changing audience's tastes to animate possession innovatively and effectively. Even when they are not as adept at moving spirits in ritual, they master moving bodies in concerts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Postcolonial scholars have argued for the provincialization of urban knowledge, but doing so remains an opaque process. This paper argues that explicit attention to 'learning to unlearn' unstated theoretical assumptions and normativities can aid in provincialization, and demonstrate ways in which theorizing entails a socio-spatial situation. The authors' efforts to grapple with operationalizing learning to unlearn in three different urban cases are described, followed by an articulation of strategies for theorizing which more explicitly acknowledge theory-building's situatedness as well as points of reflection for developing postcolonial urban theory. It is argued that this usefully shifts the focus of unlearning from 'who' is theorizing 'where' towards theory's unstated norms and assumptions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Self-service technology (SST) is rapidly gaining traction in the restaurant industry, yet the impact on consumer behavior remains to be seen. This study lends a theoretical perspective to the growing issue of SST and its effect on consumer donation behavior. From the lens of costly signaling theory, we examine how the use of SST impacts guest responses to cause-related marketing (CRM) initiatives. Employing an experimental design, we found that customers who were solicited in the presence of others were more likely to donate than those solicited via SST. These results suggest that when the participation decision is conspicuous, donating is a way to raise social status in front of others. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has examined the joint impact of SST and matching donations on the customer's participation in CRM programs. Our findings suggest that SST adoption may have unintended consequences for corporations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although note taking is frequently described as an important skill for postsecondary success, there have been few note-taking intervention studies involving multiple sessions spanning more than one week. In a systematic search, we identified seven peer-reviewed articles reporting 10 intervention studies published from 1990-2014. The only single-case design study addressed taking notes from texts, but four treatment-comparison studies that taught note taking during lectures assessed students' abilities when taking notes from texts. The remaining four treatment-comparison and one single-group design studies focused solely on note taking during lectures. Three types of notes were represented in the corpus: guided (seven studies), split-page (two studies), and self-restructured (one study). In comparing students who did and did not receive note-taking instruction, Hedges's g effect sizes on outcome measures of content learning and note quality ranged from -0.35 to 2.11. Across nine group design studies, the weighted average effect was 0.54 (CI95 = 0.47 to 0.62). The weighted average Tau-U of the single-case design was 1.00 (CI95 = 0.60 to 1.40).",

      "Abstract Note" : "Identification of sharks within the genus Mustelus (smoothhound sharks) is problematic because of extensive overlap in external morphology among species. Consequently, species-specific management of smoothhound shark resources is difficult when multiple species inhabit the same geographic region. The species identification and distribution of smoothhound sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf) were assessed using sequences of mitochondrial DNA, nuclear-encoded microsatellites, and catch data. Phylogenetic analysis of 1,047 base pairs of mitochondrially encoded ND-2 sequences and Bayesian clustering of multilocus genotypes at 15 microsatellites revealed three genetically distinct monophyletic lineages (clades) of smoothhound sharks in the Gulf. Examination of external morphology revealed characters that distinguished each genetically distinct clade, and based on species descriptions and comparisons with the type and other specimens in established collections, the lineages were identified as Smooth Dogfish Mustelus canis, Florida Smoothhound Mustelus norrisi, and Gulf Smoothhound Mustelus sinusmexicanus. Two hundred and eighty-seven smoothhound sharks sampled from across the Gulf were then assigned unequivocally, based on genetic data, to one of the three species. Multifactorial analysis and homogeneity tests of species-specific means versus grand means of spatiotemporal factors (depth, longitude, and month) at capture indicated significant differences among the three species with respect to all three factors. On average, the Smooth Dogfish is found in deeper waters than the Gulf Smoothhound, whereas the Florida Smoothhound inhabits relatively shallow waters. A diagnostic key for the field identification of adult specimens of each species is provided.",

The present study aims to expand these findings by investigating this relationship through the lens of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior across both undergraduate and forensic samples. We hypothesized that, although both Factors 1 and 2 would be associated with the acquired capability for suicide, Factor 2 would exhibit a unique relationship with suicidal desire (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). Results were largely supportive of these hypotheses, although differences were noted across samples and measures. Findings highlight the importance of precision in the assessment of antisociality and suggest potential differences in the construct of psychopathy between non-criminal and criminal samples.",

Method: 21 suicide decedents completed surveys in 1994/1995 (Wave 1) and 11 completed at Wave 3; responses were compared with Chi-square and oneway ANOVA tests. Results: Suicide decedents were prone to higher delinquency and fighting at Wave 1, but not at Wave 3. At Wave 1 suicide decedents remained undistinguished from living respondents in depression, self-esteem, and drug uses. Yet, after Wave 3, the 11 respondents dying by suicide showed significantly higher depression, drug use and lower self-esteem. Conclusion: Delinquency trends can readily understood, but more complex causes are needed to account for unexpected changes in self-esteem, depression and drug uses.",

Design/methodology/approach - The experimental portion of this investigation consisted of a 2 (the presence or absence of a professor's social media accounts) x 2 (the presence or absence of a social media assignment) factorial design resulting in four conditions. Findings - The presence of a social media assignment positively influences students' intent to register for a public relations course. Research limitations/implications - The manipulation of a professor's social media use and the inclusion of a social media assignment might have been too subtle. A more explicit scenario might elicit more reactions from the participants. Practical implications - This study discussed key findings and best practices for professors who may want to use social media and the use of social media assignments in the classroom. Originality/value - This experimental investigation emerged from a distinct need to understand whether university students expect their professors to engage in social media activities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the customer's perception of customer-firm, customer-employee, and employee-firm fit and to assess how these fits impact the service experience. Design/methodology/approach - The paper looks at the impact of fit on the service experience and focusses on three specific types of dyadic fit: customer-employee; customer-firm; and employee-firm. A conceptual model is presented, accompanied by a detailed development of the hypotheses. A sample of 447 consumers is used to empirically test the proposed model. Findings - The analysis reveals the importance of fit and suggest a triadic relationship perspective is essential when designing for the service experience. Specifically, employee-firm fit is key to enhancing fit within the other dyads and providing a superior service experience. Research limitations/implications - The main implication is that this paper expands the investigation of fit by examining the interplay of multiple fits while also exploring how they affect the customer experience. The limitations are based primarily on methodology where the use of a survey to collect data rules out potential generalizations of true cause and effect while also potentially being subject to a common method effect. Practical implications - Managers should consider adopting a triadic relationship perspective when designing for the service experience. A number of managerial implications are proposed and discussed. Originality/value - Prior research has not explored the impact of fit among the customer-employee, customer-firm, and employee-firm dyads in one model on an important outcome such as the service experience. In addition, to show that customer-employee, customer-firm, and employee-firm dyadic fits are predictors of the service experience is novel.",

The purpose of this article is to address the current limitations in measuring cultural competence and to report the results of a qualitative study examining stakeholders' conceptualizations of the definition, educational process, and evaluation of cultural competence in social work education. Findings support long-standing assumptions in the literature regarding the need for social workers to develop certain knowledge and attitudes as prerequisites of becoming culturally competent, and emphasize the need for further exploration of the way social workers define cultural competence, translate it into discrete practice behaviors, and assess how students demonstrate these behaviors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Service learning is neither field education nor volunteerism. Rather, it is a pedagogical approach designed to reinforce classroom instruction with concurrent service activities occurring in the local community. This service is driven by community-identified needs. Service learning supports social work values, yet the profession has been slow to embrace it in social work education. This article reports results of a national survey examining the use of service learning among baccalaureate programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The majority of respondents report service learning is a required component of at least one course (generally an introductory or practice-based course) and has been incorporated into their programs for more than a decade. Results also suggest some programs may not implement service learning appropriately as it remains undifferentiated from volunteerism or field education.",

      "Abstract Note" : "It has been suggested that children acquire spelling by picking up conditional sound-spelling consistencies. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated how variation in word characteristics (words that vary systematically in terms of phoneme-grapheme correspondences) and child factors (individual differences in the ability to extract phonological, morphological, and orthographic information) simultaneously relates to spelling accuracy. A total of 143 Korean-speaking children were assessed on spelling 4 times from prekindergarten to kindergarten. Words in the spelling task systematically varied in orthographic transparency stemming from phonological shifts. At Time 1 they were also assessed on emergent literacy or linguistic awareness skills (e.g., phonological awareness, morphological awareness, letter-name knowledge). Explanatory item response model revealed that (a) growth trajectories of spelling differed as a function of orthographic transparency, and (b) the effect of emergent literacy skills on words of varying transparency differed as a function of children's emergent literacy skill levels and time.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In English, gains in decoding skill do not map directly onto increases in word reading. However, beyond the Self-Teaching Hypothesis, little is known about the transfer of decoding skills to word reading. In this study, we offer a new approach to testing specific decoding elements on transfer to word reading. To illustrate, we modeled word-reading gains among children with reading disability enrolled in Phonological and Strategy Training (PHAST) or Phonics for Reading (PFR). Conditions differed in sublexical training with PHAST stressing multilevel connections and PFR emphasizing simple grapheme-phoneme correspondences. Thirty-seven children with reading disability, 3rd to 6th grade, were randomly assigned 60 lessons of PHAST or PFR. Crossed random-effects models allowed us to identify specific intervention elements that differentially impacted word-reading performance at posttest, with children in PHAST better able to read words with variant vowel pronunciations. Results suggest that sublexical emphasis influences transfer gains to word reading.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Since its inception in 1989, Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) has promoted excellence in medical student education. CDIM members move medical education forward by sharing innovations in curriculum and assessment and discoveries related to educating our students and administering our programs. The Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine, of which CDIM is a founding member, broadens the umbrella beyond student education to include five academically focused specialty organizations representing departments of medicine, teaching hospitals, and medical schools working together to advance learning, discovery, and caring. CDIM held its 2015 annual meeting at Academic Internal Medicine Week in Atlanta, Georgia. This year 36 innovation and research submissions were selected for either oral abstract or poster presentation. The quality of the presentations was outstanding this year and included many of the most important issues in medical education. The CDIM research committee selected the following seven abstracts as being of the highest quality, the most generalizable, and relevant to the readership of Teaching and Learning in Medicine. Two abstracts include information from the CDIM annual survey, which remains a rich source for answering questions about student education on a national level. Looking at trends in medical education, three of the seven selected abstracts mention entrustable professional activities. Three of the abstracts address how we assess student skill and provide them with appropriate feedback. These include two schools' approach to bringing milestones into the medical student realm, use of objective structured clinical exam for assessing clinical skill in clerkship, and what students want in terms of feedback. Four articles deal with curricular innovation. These include interprofessional education, high-value care, transitions of care, and internship preparation. We are pleased to share these abstracts, which represent the breadth and quality of thought of our CDIM members.",

The purpose of this article is to first highlight the effect of sub-clusters within the majority class on the detection of the minority instances and then handle the imbalanced classification problem by learning the structure in the data. We propose a decomposition-based approach to a two-class imbalanced classification problem. This approach works by first learning the hidden structure of the majority class using an unsupervised learning algorithm and thus transforming the classification problem into several classification sub-problems. The base classifier is constructed on each sub-problem. The ensemble is tuned to increase its sensitivity toward the minority class. We also provide a metric for selecting the clustering algorithm by comparing estimates of the stability of the decomposition, which appears necessary for good classifier performance. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach through various real data sets.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - Based on the theoretical debates involving authenticity and consumer behavior intentions, this exploratory research study aims to identify whether the authentic experiences of tourists visiting wineries affect their behavioral intentions. Design/methodology/approach - A self-administered questionnaire was created to address authenticity issues within the context of the on-site winery experience and how they ultimately affected behavioral intentions according to selected demographic characteristics. Adapting Wang's categorization of authenticity as being composed of three dimensions, a total of 13 questions were developed and used to obtain consumer data. To determine whether these three dimensions related to authenticity affected visitors' behavioral intentions within the context of the winery experience, a standard multiple regression procedure was used at a levels = 0.05 and 0.01. Findings - The findings show that authentic characteristics play a substantial role in the behavioral intentions of winery tourists. Interestingly, there were no significant relationships between a visitor's willingness to recommend wineries and the on-site winery experience, presentation of wine bottle labeling and impressions about the overall winery experience. Research limitations implications - Because this was an exploratory study, repeated applications of this experiment must be conducted in many other global destinations where winery visits occur, to establish generalizable research findings. Future applications of this research study should consider introducing new variables to further measure authenticity related to on-site winery visits, not only to build upon these study findings but also to assist the wine industry marketing professionals in acquiring a better understanding of the relationship between authenticity, as related to on-site winery visits, and the behavioral intentions of winery visitors. Practical implications - This study's findings will help to better understand the behavioral intentions of winery visitors based upon the perceived authenticity levels of on-site winery experiences. The results provide strategic and developmental directions for wine industry professionals, winery owners, wine producers and wine destination marketing organizations to more accurately promote winery visits, products and destinations. Originality/value - Although authenticity and wine tourism have both received much attention as research topics, no research, to date, has addressed the importance of perceived authenticity, as applied to the on-site winery visit, within the overall wine tourism experience and its effect upon visitor intentions. This study endeavored to quantify the attributes of authenticity that are specific to winery tourism and consumer behavior issues.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test Oliver's two-dimension (fortitude and community/social support) product loyalty framework. Design/methodology/approach - Oliver categorized each of the two dimensions into high and low, creating a two-by-two framework: low fortitude and low-community/social support (Product Superiority group); low fortitude and high-community/social support (Village Envelopment group); high fortitude and low-community/social support (Determined Self-isolation group); high fortitude and high-community/social support (Immersed Self-identity group). The paper uses two samples. The sample from Study 1 was season ticket holders (n = 199) of a West Coast (USA) Major League Baseball team. Results indicated preliminary support for Oliver's four groups and good psychometric properties of the fan community scale and the individual fortitude scale (IFS). Study 2 focussed on attendees (n = 458) at two East Coast (USA) Major League Baseball venues. Findings - The multivariate GLM indicated significant differences among Oliver's groups, but the variance explained was small on past, current, and future attendance. However, in terms of actual games attended, the Immersed Self-identity group attended between 2.5 and 3 times as many games as the Village Envelopment group over the two years, and more than twice as many games as the Product Superiority group. The groups differed substantially on consumption of product extensions: 22.5 percent of the variance in merchandise purchasing was explained by the grouping, 31.9 percent of broadcast media consumption, and 24.9 percent of print media consumption. In all cases, those in the Immersed Self-identity group consumed significantly more than the Product Superiority and Determined Self-isolation groups. Originality/value - The paper reveals that sport marketers can focus on the Immersed Self-identity segment as the segment most likely to consume the product, repurchase, and purchase product extensions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - Endogeneity is a potential threat to the validity of international marketing (IM) research. The purpose of this paper is to draw the attention of IM researchers to issues of endogeneity, to provide a comprehensive overview of the sources of endogeneity, and to discuss the statistical solutions. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct the research in two steps. In the first step, the authors review the nature and sources of endogeneity specifically in IM research. In the second step, the authors review 60 IM papers on endogeneity published in the period 1995-2014 and assess the current practice of addressing endogeneity in the IM literature. Findings - Sample selection bias and simultaneity are prevalent sources of endogeneity in IM research. Internationalization-performance relationship and innovation-export nexus are the two most frequently adopted models subject to potential endogeneity. Simply lagging the main independent variable is statistically flawed in dealing with endogeneity despite its popularity in IM research. Research limitations/implications - First, a careful choice and application of methods are critical when addressing endogeneity. Second, the authors suggest the employment of multiple study methods to address endogeneity robustly. Third, to prevent or solve endogeneity in structural equation modeling, researchers may either collect data on independent and dependent variables from different respondents or employ a two-stage least squares approach. Finally, it is helpful to design dedicated models to prevent proactively potential endogeneity a priori. Originality/value - The contribution of this study is twofold. First, it is the first in the literature to discuss the endogeneity issue specifically in IM research. In particular, the study elaborates the origins and consequences of the three most frequently confronted types of endogeneity in IM research. Second, the authors assess the four major methods of addressing endogeneity in IM research with a systematic discussion of the literature from the last two decades. The authors offer suggestions on how to minimize endogeneity in model design and empirical implementation for future IM research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - This paper aims to provide an evaluation of the findings first put forward in the article \"A cross-sectional test of the effect and conceptualization of service value\" with the benefit of hindsight, and to offer directions for further research and developments in the research area. Design/methodology/approach - Research directions which emanated from the publication of the paper have been examined in the light of current service(s) marketing theory and practice. As a result, promising current and future strands of research have been identified. Findings - The focus of both the original and this paper is on the conceptualization and measurement of the value construct. Although much theory has been advanced relative to the measurement of value, the marketing literature lacks a conceptualization and measures that reflect this theory. Research limitations/implications - The implication of the paper is that marketing scholars tend to focus more on to other studies before exhausting the opportunities to identify and test appropriate conceptualizations and measures of core marketing constructs such as value, quality, sacrifice and satisfaction. Practical implications - Although value is universally identified as a major driver of consumer decision-making, a full appreciation of its role in the strategic marketing efforts of organizations depends on having an accurate conceptualization and measures. The original paper and this revisit motivate and assist organizations in their efforts to better understand value and its impact in the decisions made by consumers. Social implications - To contribute to the needs and wants of society, organizations must identify what is valued by society. The original and this revisit identify the creation of value as a basic need in encouraging consumer behaviours when the intent is to satisfy societal needs or desires. Originality/value - The original paper was highly rated, and generated discussion and important further research. It has value as part of the history of service marketing research. The retrospective analysis by the authors gives a unique insight into processes and thinking associated with understanding key aspects that contribute to the historical development of service marketing, and provides substantial food for thought for future research directions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Looking for, recognizing, and using underlying mathematical structure is an important aspect of mathematical reasoning. We explore the use of mathematical structure in children's integer strategies by developing and exemplifying the construct of logical necessity. Students in our study used logical necessity to approach and use numbers in a formal, algebraic way, leveraging key mathematical ideas about inverses, the structure of our number system, and fundamental properties. We identified the use of carefully chosen comparisons as a key feature of logical necessity and documented three types of comparisons students made when solving integer tasks. We believe that logical necessity can be applied in various mathematical domains to support students to successfully engage with mathematical structure across the K-12 curriculum.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Numerous critical load applications rely upon a line-interactive uninterruptible power supply system to maintain power during outages as well as during under- and over-voltage utility conditions. When any disturbance occurs at the utility side, the line-interactive uninterruptible power supply system takes over the load within a few milliseconds to avoid interruption. However, during this transition of load, a significant inrush current occurs due to the magnetic saturation of the load transformer. The inrush current phenomenon causes reduced line voltages and sometimes activates the over-current protection of the uninterruptible power supply system. This article proposes a new line-interactive uninterruptible power supply system that eliminates the inrush current phenomenon by connecting a standard current-regulated voltage source inverter to the secondary of the load transformer. During any transient condition at the utility side, the load current is monitored and regulated to achieve a seamless compensation or transition of load. Experimental results are obtained for a prototype during a number of possible irregular utility power conditions to endorse the performance of the proposed uninterruptible power supply system.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: Major depression and related mood disorders are the most common long-term outcomes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the potentially debilitating consequences of depression, and the fact that TBI patients are frequently refractory to antidepressant drugs, new therapies are clearly needed. We hypothesized that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), delivered intravenously, can effectively treat TBI-induced depression and other behavioral deficits associated with TBI. Methods: Rats (n= 8 per group) were subjected to experimental TBI or control sham operation. Six hours post TBI, rats were treated with 1 x 10(6) hMSC or vehicle control Immediately after TBI and prior to hMSC or control treatment, rats were subjected to either targeted precision x-ray irradiation to eliminate subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation or sham irradiation. One week after TBI, SVZ irradiation, and hMSC treatment, rats were evaluated for the depression -like behavior, anhedonia, using the two-bottle saccharin preference paradigm; and for working memory using the novel object recognition test. Results: TBI resulted in a 54% (p < 0.05) decrease in saccharin preference scores while treatment of TBI with hMSC fully prevented this anhedonic behavior. TBI was also found to produce a 73% (p < 0.05) decrease in novel object interaction time, indicating impaired working memory, and was similarly improved by treatment with hMSC. The ability of hMSC to prevent TBI-associated depression and working memory impairment was eliminated when SVZ proliferation was inhibited by irradiation. Conclusions: This work has identified a possible role for hMSC in the treatment of TBI-induced depression and other behaviors and suggests a mechanistic role for proliferative cells of the SVZ proliferation in hMSC efficacy.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent increased interest in computational thinking poses an important question to researchers: What are the best ways to teach fundamental computing concepts to students? Visualization is suggested as one way of supporting student learning. This mixed-method study aimed to (i) examine the effect of instruction in which students constructed visualizations on students' programming achievement and students' attitudes toward computer programming, and (ii) explore how this kind of instruction supports students' learning according to their self-reported experiences in the course. The study was conducted with 58 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in their second programming class. They expect to teach information technology and computing-related courses at the primary and secondary levels. An embedded experimental model was utilized as a research design. Students in the experimental group were given instruction that required students to construct visualizations related to sorting, whereas students in the control group viewed pre-made visualizations. After the instructional intervention, eight students from each group were selected for semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the intervention based on visualization construction resulted in significantly better acquisition of sorting concepts. However, there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to students' attitudes toward computer programming. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students in the experimental group constructed necessary abstractions through their engagement in visualization construction activities. The authors of this study argue that the students' active engagement in the visualization construction activities explains only one side of students' success. The other side can be explained through the instructional approach, constructionism in this case, used to design instruction. The conclusions and implications of this study can be used by researchers and instructors dealing with computational thinking.",

While the Spanish transition was initiated with Francisco Franco's death in 1975, and the Chilean transition with Augusto Pinochet supposedly stepping down in 1989, in both cases the dictatorial power structures ensured that such a shift in political ideology did not come into effect overnight. As a result, well after Franco's death and Pinochet's defeat, the regimes' institutions remained in place. With this political context in mind, food features prominently as a metaphorical representation of the complex power struggles and political shifts that were occurring in these two countries at this time. In this way, the relationship of food-presented as either good or bad, edible or contaminated-is conflated with character development in such a way that it establishes a new set of semantic networks among characters that illuminates sociocultural dynamics and political debates in transitional Spain and Chile.",

Four processes were considered in the context of a PD program focused on student mathematical errors: analysis of students' mathematical misconceptions as a lever for changing practice; review and discussion of images of existing and innovative teaching practices; video-enhanced reflection and detailing of new practices; and cycles of examination/implementation and feedback/revision. Participants were four US elementary school teachers, whose engagement in the PD program was studied through video observations and interviews. Findings revealed several positive shifts in teachers' interests and classroom practices. Challenges involved teacher content knowledge and counteracting cultural beliefs and practices on the role of errors in learning. The conclusions discuss implications for PD scale-up.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have shown the ability to self-organize into different types of neural organoids (e.g., whole brain organoids, cortical spheroids, midbrain organoids etc.) recently. The extrinsic and intrinsic signaling elicited by Wnt pathway, Hippo/Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway, and extracellular microenvironment plays a critical role in brain tissue morphogenesis. This article highlights recent advances in neural tissue patterning from hPSCs, in particular the role of Wnt pathway and YAP activity in this process. Understanding the Wnt-YAP interactions should provide us the guidance to predict and modulate brain-like tissue structure through the regulation of extracellular microenvironment of hPSCs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Randomized experiments are considered the gold standard for causal inference because they can provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects for the experimental participants. However, researchers and policymakers are often interested in using a specific experiment to inform decisions about other target populations. In education research, increasing attention is being paid to the potential lack of generalizability of randomized experiments because the experimental participants may be unrepresentative of the target population of interest. This article examines whether generalization may be assisted by statistical methods that adjust for observed differences between the experimental participants and members of a target population. The methods examined include approaches that reweight the experimental data so that participants more closely resemble the target population and methods that utilize models of the outcome. Two simulation studies and one empirical analysis investigate and compare the methods' performance. One simulation uses purely simulated data while the other utilizes data from an evaluation of a school-based dropout prevention program. Our simulations suggest that machine learning methods outperform regression-based methods when the required structural (ignorability) assumptions are satisfied. When these assumptions are violated, all of the methods examined perform poorly. Our empirical analysis uses data from a multisite experiment to assess how well results from a given site predict impacts in other sites. Using a variety of extrapolation methods, predicted effects for each site are compared to actual benchmarks. Flexible modeling approaches perform best, although linear regression is not far behind. Taken together, these results suggest that flexible modeling techniques can aid generalization while underscoring the fact that even state-of-the-art statistical techniques still rely on strong assumptions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Many have argued that moral judgment is driven by one of two types of processes. Rationalists argue that reasoned processes are the source of moral judgments, whereas sentimentalists argue that emotional processes are. We provide evidence that both positions are mistaken; there are multiple mental processes involved in moral judgment, and it is possible to manipulate which process is engaged when considering moral dilemmas by presenting them in a non-native language. The Foreign-Language Effect (FLE) is the activation of systematic reasoning processes by thinking in a foreign language. We demonstrate that the FLE extends to moral judgment. This indicates that different types of processes can lead to the formation of differing moral judgments. One implication of the FLE is that it raises the possibility that moral judgments can be made more systematic, and that the type of processing used to form them might be relevant to normative and applied ethics.",

Study 1 showed that stronger belief in free will was correlated with more gratitude, greater life satisfaction, lower levels of perceived life stress, a greater sense of self-efficacy, greater perceived meaning in life, higher commitment in relationships, and more willingness to forgive relationship partners. Study 2 showed that the belief in free will was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction, meaning in life, gratitude, and self-efficacy than either locus of control or implicit person theory. Study 3 showed that experimentally manipulating disbelief in free will caused a reduction in the perceived meaningfulness of life. Study 4 found that inducing a stronger belief in free will caused people to set more meaningful goals for themselves. The possible concern that believers in free will simply claim all manner of positive traits was contradicted by predicted null findings with regard to sense of humor, empathy, and self-rated attractiveness. Taken together, the present studies show that the belief in free will is a strong predictor of several positive traits and outcomes.",

By focusing on the organizational contexts and structures that art therapy practices are typically situated within, the purpose of the study was to understand: How the values that art therapists intrinsically hold within practice transmitted, translated, and interpreted by other mental health professionals. To gain rich and detailed views, nine mental health professionals were interviewed. Through analysis of the findings, a critically reflexive form of practice was developed to assist art therapists in substantiating their role, while strengthening a team mentality to provide better services to their clients. Study implications involve the need to further explore how art therapists can develop professionally, as well as expand on strategies for how art therapy can be further valued within mental health systems.",

Besides a documentary film, Primo' Levi's Journey, the result of this experience has been a small volume authored by Belpoliti, La prova (The Trial'). Originally conceived as a re narration of Levi's path, Belpoliti's book shows however to possess a remarkable thematic articulation: the scenarios described by Belpoliti are in fact with those of an archaeological exploration amongst the ruins of the twentieth century (the ruins of Auschwitz, of real socialism, of Chernobyl, ruins that mirror the analogous collapses of the Berlin Wall and of the World Trade Center), surrounded by a kitsch taste, which seems to have become a dominant aesthetical feature of postmodern culture, and immersed in what Belpoliti efficaciously defines as a tempo penultimo : the time of a crisis that cannot end.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Panic attacks (PAs) are characterized by overwhelming surges of fear and discomfort and are one of the most frequently occurring symptoms in psychiatric populations. The most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (i.e. DSM-5) allows for a panic attack (PA) specifier for all disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, there is little research examining differences between individuals diagnosed with SAD with the PA specifier versus individuals diagnosed with SAD without the PA specifier. The current study examined social anxiety, mood, anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity social concerns, a risk factor for social anxiety in SAD-diagnosed individuals without (N=52) and with (N=14) the PA specifier. The groups differed only in somatic symptoms of anxiety. Result of the current study provides preliminary evidence that the presence of the PA specifier in social anxiety does not result in elevated levels of comorbidity or a more severe presentation of social anxiety.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In recent years, mainly due to the specific health benefits associated with (1) the discovery of bioactive peptides in protein hydrolysates, (2) the reduction of protein allergenicity by protein hydrolysis, and (3) the improved protein digestibility and absorption of protein hydrolysates, the utilization of protein hydrolysates in functional foods and beverages has significantly increased. Although the specific health benefits from different hydrolysates are somewhat proven, the delivery and/or stability of these benefits is debatable during distribution, storage, and consumption. In this review, we discuss (1) the quality changes in different food protein hydrolysates during storage; (2) the resulting changes in the structure and texture of three food matrices, i.e., low moisture foods (LMF, a(w) < 0.6), intermediate moisture foods (IMF, 0.6 < a, < 0.85), and high moisture foods (HMF, a(w) > 0.85); and (3) the potential solutions to improve storage stability of food protein hydrolysates. In addition, we note there is a great need for evaluation of biofunction availability of bioactive peptides in food protein hydrolysates during storage.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent research has demonstrated a disconnect between environmental beliefs and behavior when it comes to the consumption of hospitality products. Unfortunately, while many consumers believe that hotels should engage in green practices, there is mounting evidence that such beliefs do not necessarily translate into actual purchases of sustainable products. The purpose of this research is to examine this issue by developing an integrated framework establishing the relationships among the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors associated with the consumption of the green hotel product. In particular, we are concerned with the effects of consumers' beliefs regarding the luxury-based trade-offs associated with staying in green hotels. Additionally, we seek to establish the role of destination image as a determinant of the relationships specified in the proposed nomology. The results support our overall hypothesis that the established disconnect between environmental values and sustainable hospitality consumption behavior is at least partially attributable to the cognitive evaluation of the attributes of the hotel's destination. Specifically, our results show that, while the belief that green hotels are less luxurious translates to unfavorable attitudes toward green hotels in urban tourism destinations, this relationship does not occur in nature-based tourism destinations.",

To consider how immediate environment influences FFV, this study uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey (N=122,265) to examine the influence of sprawl on FFV consumption. Findings indicate that higher sprawl relates to lower FFV consumption, and this relationship persists net of demographic covariates. Implications offer that social work's person-in-environment approach can increase FFV access in under-resourced communities.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Adult obesity in the United States has risen to epidemic proportions, and mental health professionals must be called to action. The objectives of this article were to (a) synthesize outcomes of behavioral health interventions for adult obesity in recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews (MAs/SRs) as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and further, (b) evaluate the role of mental health professionals in these behavioral health interventions. Articles were included if published in English between January 1, 2004, and May 1, 2014, in peer-reviewed journals examining behavioral health interventions for adults with obesity. Data were subsequently extracted and independently checked by two authors. Included MAs/SRs utilized motivational interviewing, financial incentives, multicomponent behavioral weight management programs, as well as dietary and lifestyle interventions. Behavioral health interventions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were discussed across 3 major intervention types (educational, modified caloric intake, cognitive-based). Regarding the 1st study objective, multiple positive primary (e.g., weight loss) and secondary outcomes (e.g., quality of life) were found in both MAs/SRs and RCTs. However, the majority of included studies made no mention of interventionist professional background and little inference could be made regarding the effects of professional background on behavioral health intervention outcomes for adults facing obesity; an important limitation and direction for future research. Future studies should assess the effects of interventionist profession in addition to primary and secondary outcomes for adults facing obesity. Implications for mental health professionals' educational curricula, assessment, and treatment strategies are discussed.",

Two factorial experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. By manipulating the preconsumption mood and the type of service failure information provided after service failure (explanation in Study 1 and excuse in Study 2), the mechanism through which preconsumption mood impacts customer evaluations in the restaurant context was investigated. The findings lend support to the affect priming model, indicating that preconsumption mood can directly impact consumer satisfaction and loyalty in a mood-congruent fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize explanations and excuses to test two competing theories, affect priming and affect-as-information. These results contribute to the hospitality literature by shedding light on mechanism through which preconsumption mood influences customers' postfailure evaluations.",

It also examines the moderating role of preconsumption mood in processing the information. Using information processing theory as a framework, hypotheses were developed using hypothetical scenarios and surveys. Our results demonstrated that participants in the positive mood condition reported higher expectations for the team's performance, more positive attitude, and stronger intent to purchase when the ads contained the superstition cue, whereas participants in the negative mood condition did not. These results expand the literature on superstitious consumer behavior by demonstrating that companies can not only address superstitions that consumers already hold, but can also induce superstitious beliefs in customers. By doing so, managers and marketers may be able to positively influence consumers' attitudes toward the company and loyalty behaviors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Understanding differences in oral language abilities is vital, particularly for children from low-income homes and minority children who are at an increased risk for academic failure because of differences or deficits in language use or exposure before they enter school. The purpose of this study was to investigate oral language performance, including receptive and expressive vocabulary, grammar, and sentence imitation, among a diverse group of kindergarten students (n=503). Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined the contributions of student race (African American or non-African American), student socioeconomic status (SES), and school-wide SES to oral language performance. In separate analyses, we found significant absolute effects of both race and individual SES. However, when analyzed simultaneously, only race was a significant predictor for all measures. We also found that both identification as African American and school-wide SES were significant predictors of oral language performance. We discuss implications for practice and future research.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess how the study of consumer behavior can benefit from the presence of Big Data. Design/methodology/approach - This paper offers a conceptual overview of potential opportunities and changes to the study of consumer behavior that Big Data will likely bring. Findings - Big Data have the potential to further our understanding of each stage in the consumer decision-making process. While the field has traditionally moved forward using a priori theory followed by experimentation, it now seems that the nature of the feedback loop between theory and results may shift under the weight of Big Data. Research limitations/implications - A new data culture is now represented in marketing practice. The new group advocates inductive data mining and A/B testing rather than human intuition harnessed for deduction. The group brings with it interest in numerous secondary data sources. However, Big Data may be limited by poor quality, unrepresentativeness and volatility, among other problems. Practical implications - Managers who need to understand consumer behavior will need a workforce with different skill sets than in the past, such as Big Data consumer analytics. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first articles to assess how the study of consumer behavior can evolve in the context of the Big Data revolution.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In recent years, a focus on individual student needs has set the stage for tailoring educational interventions to address issues of students who are not working up to educational proficiency standards outlined in the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation. This new pedagogical model may provide a unique opportunity to meet the needs of high-ability students who are not working to their potential in the classroom. Research indicates that gifted students allowed to work on material beyond the common core curriculum instead of merely maintaining the pace of the rest of the class actually perform better on end-of-the-year testing in math and science than gifted controls who did not pursue additional work. Bright students, like all students, demonstrate increased motivation and classroom performance when provided with academic material that appropriately challenges them. Response to intervention (RtI) establishes differentiated curriculum as the standard in America's schools. It holds promise for all students, not only students who are lagging behind. RtI addresses student underperformance, whether due to a lack of motivation, boredom, or any number of potential factors moderating the learning of high-ability students as well as the average learner. This article reports on a study that developed and field tested a procedural guide for implementation of the RtI model with gifted students.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose: The primary aim of the present study was to examine whether different ways of presenting narrative stimuli (i.e., live narrative stimuli versus audio-recorded narrative stimuli) influence children's performances on narrative comprehension and oral-retell quality. Method: Children in kindergarten (n = 54), second grade (n = 74), and fourth grade (n = 65) were matched on their performance on a standardized oral-language comprehension task and then were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 conditions that differed in how narrative stimuli were presented to children: live narrative stimuli and audio-recorded narrative stimuli. Results: Kindergartners and 2nd graders in the live condition had higher mean performance on narrative comprehension, with effect sizes of .43 and .39, respectively, after accounting for age, gender, and school. No differences were found in narrative comprehension for children in 4th grade. Children's oral-retell quality did not differ as a function of condition in any grade. Conclusion: These results suggest that how narrative stimuli are presented to children (i.e., live versus audio-recorded narrative stimuli) may affect children's narrative comprehension, particularly for young children in kindergarten and Grade 2. Implications for assessment and instruction are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In a discrete-time market, we study model-independent superhedging where the semi-static superhedging portfolio consists of three parts: static positions in liquidly traded vanilla calls, static positions in other tradable, yet possibly less liquid, exotic options, and a dynamic trading strategy in risky assets under certain constraints. By considering the limit order book of each tradable exotic option and employing the Monge-Kantorovich theory of optimal transport we establish a general superhedging duality, which admits a natural connection to convex risk measures. With the aid of this duality, we derive a model-independent version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing. The notion \"finite optimal arbitrage profit\", weaker than no-arbitrage, is also introduced. It is worth noting that our method covers a large class of delta and gamma constraints.",

We posit that some managers provide inaccurate downward guidance to increase the positive surprise and pricing premium at the earnings announcement, thereby maximizing profits from selling shares following the earnings announcement. In support, we document that managers are more likely to have issued prior inaccurate downward guidance when they sell more shares or increase their selling activities following the earnings announcement. Further, we show that these managers benefit economically by linking inaccurate downward guidance to greater pricing premiums at the earnings announcement date and more positive cumulative stock returns over the period from inaccurate downward guidance to subsequent earnings announcement.

We used regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of two award levels, which had different SAT/ACT thresholds, on the probability of students choosing in-state public colleges and four-year public colleges. The most consistent and robust finding was the positive, significant increases in the probability of attending Florida's public colleges and in the probability of choosing four-year public colleges for those students who barely met the program eligibility criteria when compared with those who barely missed those criteria. That is, the evidence presented in this analysis points to the fact that the Bright Future programs significantly altered students' college choices, both in terms of attending in-state public colleges and four-year public colleges. Although this finding held at different award levels and for students who took the SAT and/or ACT tests, the magnitude of the program effect varied along these factors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The role of aesthetics has been widely debated in the field of Maghrebi Literary Studies since its inception in the early 1960s. Francophone novels from the Maghreb are often called upon by publishers to serve as sociologically faithful reflections of North African society. At the same time, such works have been routinely criticized by scholars for their lack of literary artistry. The twenty-first century arrival of independent publishing houses in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia has altered the flow of cultural capital across the Mediterranean, with new centers of literary production shifting the landscape of French publishing. These local publishers afford Maghrebi writers the space in which to create narratives that complicate existing paradigms for postcolonial fiction. My paper addresses the relationship between literary aesthetics and national consciousness in recent novels from the catalogue of editions Barzakh, Algeria's most important independent publisher. I argue that Barzakh has expanded the horizon of possibility for the roman maghrebin in the twenty-first century by publishing texts that skirt the realist/formalist tug-of-war to which literatures from North Africa are so often subjected.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often use maladaptive strategies to control intrusive thoughts (e.g., thought suppression) that may paradoxically increase their frequency. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment has been associated with decreased use of these disadvantageous strategies and increased use of advantageous ones. This study examines changes in thought control strategies among patients with severe OCD receiving ERP in an intensive residential setting. Thought suppression has also been associated with suicidality; thus, we tested whether suicide risk moderated changes in thought control from admission to discharge. Consistent with prior research, patients reported decreased use of worry and punishment, and increased use of distraction and social control. Suicide risk moderated changes in the use of distraction, such that high risk patients employed this strategy less frequently at admission, but no group differences remained at discharge. Additionally, only high risk patients increased their use of distraction over treatment. Furthermore, increased use of distraction and decreased use of self-punishment predicted reduced symptoms at discharge. These findings suggest that OCD patients at high risk for suicide may particularly benefit from interventions that facilitate focused distraction from intrusive thoughts. Further, dispositional use of distraction and self-punishment strategies may be worthwhile targets in the treatment of OCD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Anxiety sensitivity (AS), defined as the extent to which individuals believe that anxiety-related sensations have harmful consequences, is associated with smoking processes and poorer clinical outcomes among trauma-exposed smokers. Yet the specific mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility is a construct implicated in multiple manifestations of mood regulation that may underlie smoking behavior. The current study examined the explanatory role of smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility in terms of the relation between AS and indices of smoking behavior among trauma-exposed smokers. The sample consisted of 217 treatment-seeking adult smokers (44% female; M age = 37.8; SD = 13.2; age range: 18-65 years), who were exposed to at least one lifetime Criterion A trauma event (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR] Criterion A for trauma exposure). Bootstrap analysis (5,000 re-samples) revealed that AS was indirectly related to the (a) number of cigarettes smoked per day, (b) number of years being a daily smoker, (c) number of failed quit attempts, and (d) heaviness of smoking index among trauma-exposed smokers through its relation with smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility. These findings provide initial evidence suggesting that smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility may be an important construct in better understanding AS-smoking relations among trauma-exposed smokers. Future work is needed to explore the extent to which smoking-specific avoidance and inflexibility account for relations between AS and other smoking processes (e.g., withdrawal, cessation outcome) in the context of trauma and smoking comorbidity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The compound Cr4US8 has been synthesized at 1073 K and its crystal structure has been determined at 100 K. The structure is modulated with a two-fold commensurate supercell. The subcell may be indexed in an orthorhombic cell but weak supercell reflections lead to the monoclinic superspace group P2(1)/c (0 alpha gamma)0s with two Cr sites, one U site, and four S sites. The structure comprises a three-dimensional framework of CrS6 octahedra with channels that are partially occupied by U atoms. Each U atom in these channels is coordinated by eight S atoms in a bicapped trigonal-prismatic arrangement. The magnetic behavior of Cr4US8 is complex. At temperatures above similar to 120 K at all measured fields, there is little difference between field-cooled and zero field-cooled data and chi(T) decreases monotonously with temperature, which is reminiscent of the Curie-Weiss law. At lower temperatures, the temperature dependence of chi(T) is complex and strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Worry, the anticipation of future threat, is a common feature of anxiety and mood psychopathology. Considerable research has examined the latent structure of worry to determine whether this construct reflects a dimensional or taxonic structure. Recent taxometric investigations have provided support for a unidimensional structure of worry; however, the results of these studies are limited in that taxometric approaches are unable to assess for the presence of more than two classes of a given construct. Given the complex nature of worry, it is possible that worry may actually reflect a latent structure comprised of multiple classes that cannot be assessed through taxometric approaches. Thus, it is important to utilize newer statistical techniques, such as factor-mixture modeling (FMM), which allow for a more nuanced assessment of the latent structure of a given psychological construct The aim of the current study was to examine the latent structure of worry using FMM. It was predicted that worry would reflect a three-class structure comprised of (1) a class of low, normative levels of worry, (2) a class of moderate, subclinical worry, and (3) a class of high, pervasive worry. The latent class structure of worry was assessed using FMM in a sample of 1337 participants recruited from the community through a research clinic. Results revealed a three-class structure of the PSWQ comprising low, moderate-high, and high classes of worry. We also provided convergent and discriminant validity of the worry classes by demonstrating that the high worry class was most associated with GAD and that the low worry class was the least associated with GAD. The clinical utility of the worry classes, including the creation of empirically based cut-scores, and the implications for future research are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents a recently developed software, ArcGIS-based Nitrogen Load Estimation Toolkit (ArcNLET), for estimating nitrogen loading from septic systems to surface water bodies. The load estimation is important for managing nitrogen pollution, a world-wide challenge to water resources and environmental management. ArcNLET simulates coupled transport of ammonium and nitrate in both vadose zone and groundwater. This is a unique feature that cannot be found in other ArcGIS-based software for nitrogen modeling. ArcNLET is designed to be flexible for the following four simulating scenarios: (1) nitrate transport alone in groundwater; (2) ammonium and nitrate transport in groundwater; (3) ammonium and nitrate transport in vadose zone; and (4) ammonium and nitrate transport in both vadose zone and groundwater. With this flexibility, ArcNLET can be used as an efficient screening tool in a wide range of management projects related to nitrogen pollution. From the modeling perspective, this paper shows that in areas with high water table (e.g. river and lake shores), it may not be correct to assume a completed nitrification process that converts all ammonium to nitrate in the vadose zone, because observation data can indicate that substantial amount of ammonium enters groundwater. Therefore, in areas with high water table, simulating ammonium transport and estimating ammonium loading, in addition to nitrate transport and loading, are important for avoiding underestimation of nitrogen loading. This is demonstrated in the Eggleston Heights neighborhood in the City of Jacksonville, FL, USA, where monitoring well observations included a well with predominant ammonium concentrations. The ammonium loading given by the calibrated ArcNLET model can be 10-18% of the total nitrogen load, depending on various factors discussed in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite rapid growth in literacy-related programmes and evaluation in sub-Saharan Africa, little critical attention has been paid to the relevance of assumptions that underlie existing assessment methods. This study focuses on the issue of timing in the assessment of oral reading fluency, a critical component of successful reading (Chard, Vaughn, & Tyler, 2002; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), 2000; Pikulski & Chard, 2005). Within the context of the Primary Math and Reading Initiative, a randomized controlled trial of several instructional interventions in Kenya, timed and untimed Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) oral reading fluency and reading comprehension tasks were administered to 4385 students in 95 government and 125 informal schools. Using the data from the EGRA-whose administration has expanded within sub-Saharan Africa recently-we found that students did not perform significantly better on the assessments when they had more time. This pattern largely held when we examined the effects disaggregated over student ability level. This suggests that timed assessments, which are faster to administer and logistically easier, are appropriate for use in Kenya.",

A total of 420 Instagram users aged 18 to 62 years (M=29.3, SD=8.12) completed an online survey questionnaire. Analysis of a serial multiple mediator model using bootstrapping methods indicated that body image satisfaction was sequentially associated with increased Instagram selfie posting and Instagram-related conflict, which related to increased negative romantic relationship outcomes. These findings suggest that when Instagram users promote their body image satisfaction in the form of Instagram selfie posts, risk of Instagram-related conflict and negative romantic relationship outcomes might ensue. Findings from the current study provide a baseline understanding to potential and timely trends regarding Instagram selfie posting.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite was successfully launched on 28 October 2011. The on-board Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) provides the hyperspectral infrared radiance covering a spectral range of 3.92-15.4 mu m, inheriting the task to improve numerical weather prediction (NWP) from previous hyperspectral sounders. The so-called sun glint effect results in large biases in CrIS shortwave surface channels near 3.7 mu m and therefore impedes the usage of those channels in the operational data assimilation, because the data biases are required to be evaluated appropriately by any data assimilation system. This work assesses the sun glint effect on bias characteristics of those shortwave surface channels near 3.7 mu m, with the help of a sun glint model developed in the community radiative transfer model (CRTM). It is demonstrated that the daytime biases of those shortwave surface channels are decreased markedly after applying sun glint correction with values close to 0 K. The dependence of daytime biases on sensor zenith angles is also eliminated by using the sun glint model. It is seen that the differences between daytime and night-time biases can reach 0.6 K near mid-latitudes in the southern hemisphere after including the sun glint effect, which implies that the sun glint model needs further enhancement. Overall, the direct assimilation of CrIS shortwave surface channels near 3.7 mu m is possibly accomplished by utilizing the sun glint model implemented in CRTM during both daytime and night-time.",

In this article, we scrutinize one of these cases where the continued use of technology cannot be explained by one of the most prominent traditional IS models to date. We analyze our qualitative case study by juxtaposing two theoretical lenses: a traditional IS perspective (i.e., the unified theory of acceptance and use model) versus an evolutionary psychology perspective (i.e., the four-drive model). We find that a more comprehensive understanding of continued IS usage is possible when including an evolutionary psychology perspective to the existing models. Specifically, we propose three new concepts, including evolved performance expectancy, evolved effort expectancy, and evolved social influence. We also demonstrate that, in some situations, cognitive and social constructs dominate, whereas in other situations, the evolutionary dependent constructs associated with human nature take over.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper presents a geographic information system-based multi-criteria site selection tool of an olive mill wastewater (OMW) disposal site in Sidi Bouzid Region, Tunisia. The multi-criteria decision framework integrates ten constraints and six factors that relate to environmental and economic concerns, and builds a hierarchy model for OMW disposal site suitability. The methodology is used for preliminary assessment of the most suitable OMW disposal sites by combining fuzzy set theory and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The fuzzy set theory is used to standardize factors using different fuzzy membership functions while the AHP is used to establish the relative importance of the criteria. The AHP makes pairwise comparisons of relative importance between hierarchy elements grouped by both environmental and economic decision criteria. The OMW disposal site suitability is achieved by applying a weighted linear combination that uses a comparison matrix to aggregate different importance scenarios associated with environmental and economic objectives. Three different scenarios generated by different weights applied to the two objectives. The scenario (a) assigns a weight of 0.75 to the environmental and 0.25 to the economic objective, scenario (b) has equal weights, and scenario (c) features weights of 0.25 and 0.75 for environmental and economic objectives, respectively. The results from this study assign the least suitable OMW disposal site of 2.5 % when environmental and economic objectives are rated equally, while a more suitable OMW disposal site of 1.0 % is generated when the economic objective is rated higher.",

Through a continuous flow approach adapted to the dispersion system, the CNT suspension could be quantitatively characterized in real time. By continuously monitoring and identifying the evolution of mean particle size distribution and transparency of CNT suspension, the effective dispersion parameters and dispersion quality was quantified. Two types of MWNTs of different diameters and lengths were studied. For longer MWNTs with smaller diameters, the dispersion process achieved at a steady 100 nm of agglomerate size with 40 min of sonication. For shorter and large diameter and less entangled MWNTs, after 60 min of sonication, an agglomerate size of 100 nm was achieved, yet the stability decrease. The results show the potential ability of the system to optimize nanoparticle dispersion process for in-line dispersion quality control.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although response-to-instruction (RTI) approaches have received increased attention, few studies have evaluated the potential impacts of RTI approaches with preschool populations. This article presents results of 2 studies examining impacts of Tier II instruction with preschool children. Participating children were identified as substantially delayed in the acquisition of early literacy skills despite exposure to high-quality, evidence-based classroom instruction. Study 1 included 93 children (M age = 58.2 months; SD = 3.62) attending 12 Title I preschools. Study 2 included 184 children (M age = 58.2 months; SD = 3.38) attending 19 Title I preschools. The majority of children were Black/African American, and about 60% were male. In both studies, eligible children were randomized to receive either 11 weeks of need-aligned, small-group instruction or just Tier I. Tier II instruction in Study 1 included variations of activities for code-and language-focused domains with prior evidence of efficacy in non-RTI contexts. Tier II instruction in Study 2 included instructional activities narrower in scope, more intensive, and delivered to smaller groups of children. Impacts of Tier II instruction in Study 1 were minimal; however, there were significant and moderate-to-large impacts in Study 2. These results identify effective Tier II instruction but indicate that the context in which children are identified may alter the nature of Tier II instruction that is required. Children identified as eligible for Tier II in an RTI framework likely require more intensive and more narrowly focused instruction than do children at general risk of later academic difficulties.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The extent of human cooperation depends on the institutional arenas wherein people interact. Scholars from the Ostrom school have been particularly interested in how behavior in common property institutions differs from private property. Using a model of reciprocal motivations, I hypothesize that common property institutions elicit less cooperation than private property institutions in post-Communist Bulgaria. To investigate this hypothesis, this article reports on a series of experiments that examine the effects of common and private property in the trust game. The results indicate that common property institutions in Bulgaria elicit less cooperation than private property.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The current research used two 8-wave longitudinal studies spanning the first 4-5 years of 207 marriages to examine the potential bidirectional associations among marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and frequency of sex. All three variables declined over time, though the rate of decline in each variable became increasingly less steep. Controlling for these changes, own marital and sexual satisfaction were bidirectionally positively associated with one another; higher levels of marital satisfaction at one wave of assessment predicted more positive changes in sexual satisfaction from that assessment to the next and higher levels of sexual satisfaction at one wave of assessment predicted more positive changes in marital satisfaction from that assessment to the next. Likewise, own sexual satisfaction and frequency of sex were bidirectionally positively associated with one another. Additionally, partner sexual satisfaction positively predicted changes in frequency of sex and own sexual satisfaction among husbands, yet partner marital satisfaction negatively predicted changes in both frequency of sex and own sexual satisfaction. Controlling these associations, marital satisfaction did not directly predict changes in frequency of sex or vice versa. Only the association between partner sexual satisfaction and changes in own sexual satisfaction varied across men and women and none of the key effects varied across the studies. These findings suggest that sexual and relationship satisfaction are intricately intertwined and thus that interventions to treat and prevent marital distress may benefit by targeting the sexual relationship and interventions to treat and prevent sexual distress in marriage may benefit by targeting the marital relationship.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Within a large-scale distributed (or centralized) smart grid, the communication network is designed to connect multiple power management systems and collect data from hundreds or thousands of power sensors over a large geographical area. Due to the ripple effect of inconsistent communication delays, the network performance becomes a major concern to support power system applications. For example, in a large NSF project Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM), we implement a smart grid prototype, called the FREEDM Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed. The Distributed Grid Intelligences (DGIs) in the prototype can group specific peers to exchange the power among the power demands and supplies. But the grouping sometimes is not successful due to the inconsistent delays. In this paper, we present a queueing model to describe the performance of the grouping network that supports the communications among the DGIs in our smart grid prototype. First, we develop a queueing model to describe the communication traffic among the DGIs in the network with different topologies. Second, based on the network model, we analyze the delay performance and illustrate that the model can be used to predict the grouping delays. Third, we have collected extensive experimental data which is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the model. Finally, we have implemented the HIL testbed with the capabilities of integrated real-time communication and power exchange. The network model is used to investigate the influence of the communication inconsistency on the total cycle time of power operations so that new grouping protocols can be designed in the future.

      "Abstract Note" : "Simulated inter-annual to decadal variability and trends in the North Atlantic for the 1958-2007 period from twenty global ocean - sea-ice coupled models are presented. These simulations are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The study is Part II of our companion paper (Danabasoglu et al., 2014) which documented the mean states in the North Atlantic from the same models. A major focus of the present study is the representation of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability in the participating models. Relationships between AMOC variability and those of some other related variables, such as subpolar mixed layer depths, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Labrador Sea upper-ocean hydrographic properties, are also investigated. In general, AMOC variability shows three distinct stages. During the first stage that lasts until the mid-to late-1970s, AMOC is relatively steady, remaining lower than its long-term (1958-2007) mean. Thereafter, AMOC intensifies with maximum transports achieved in the mid-to late-1990s. This enhancement is then followed by a weakening trend until the end of our integration period. This sequence of low frequency AMOC variability is consistent with previous studies. Regarding strengthening of AMOC between about the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, our results support a previously identified variability mechanism where AMOC intensification is connected to increased deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic, driven by NAO-related surface fluxes. The simulations tend to show general agreement in their temporal representations of, for example, AMOC, sea surface temperature (SST), and subpolar mixed layer depth variabilities. In particular, the observed variability of the North Atlantic SSTs is captured well by all models. These findings indicate that simulated variability and trends are primarily dictated by the atmospheric datasets which include the influence of ocean dynamics from nature superimposed onto anthropogenic effects. Despite these general agreements, there are many differences among the model solutions, particularly in the spatial structures of variability patterns. For example, the location of the maximum AMOC variability differs among the models between Northern and Southern Hemispheres. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our cohort of patients who have undergone creation of abdominal wall grafts. In all patients, an iliac artery was used for inflow and either an iliac vein or the distal inferior vena cave (IVC) was use for the outflow. Ringed polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), nonringed PTFE, and bovine carotid artery were used as access conduits. Results: Our 12-patient cohort had a mean primary patency of 17.4 months with mean secondary patency of 33 months. There were no operative deaths noted and 4 total graft infections. Conclusions: Abdominal wall grafts with iliac vessel inflow and/or outflow represent viable alternatives for patients who have exhausted more traditional dialysis access options.",

In this study, we examined whether experiences with discrimination were associated with maladaptive changes in the 5 major dimensions of personality using 2 longitudinal samples that differed in age and follow-up interval. In the Health and Retirement Study, participants who perceived discrimination increased in their tendency to experience negative emotions (neuroticism), decreased in their tendency to be trusting (agreeableness), and decreased in their tendency to be organized and disciplined (conscientiousness). These associations replicated using participants from the Midlife in the United States study. The findings indicate that social pathways, in addition to biological and developmental tasks, are important for adult personality development.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Employee turnover continues to represent one of the most significant challenges faced by the U.S. restaurant industry, and customer incivility is regarded as being related to this phenomenon. In order to obtain a better understanding about the relationships between customer incivility, restaurant frontline service employee burnout and their turnover, information was obtained from 228 frontline service employees working in 28 independent Florida-based restaurants. Employees provided details of their experiences and attitudes regarding customer incivility as well as information on their job burnout and turnover intention. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for data analysis. Results confirmed that customer incivility has a positive relationship with restaurant frontline service employee job burnout. Further, this study found that the relationship between customer incivility and turnover intention through job burnout was fully mediated. The moderating roles that organizational support and supervisory support play upon the relationships between customer incivility and burnout were also investigated. Results confirmed that organizational and supervisory support moderates the relationship between customer incivility and burnout. Managerial implications for developing effective employee management strategies are provided for restaurant managers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The role of satiation as a determinant of restaurant patronage has been the subject of increasing research attention. The purpose of this research is to further consider the relationship between satiation and switching behavior in the restaurant industry. Specifically, we seek to address the mediating mechanism of service quality in this framework. Based on the related tenets of diminishing marginal utility and hedonic adaptation, we propose that satiation and service quality are inversely related. The results of an empirical analysis confirm that as consumers become satiated with food, atmosphere, and restaurant service, perceptions of these three facets of overall service quality are diminished, leading to decreased satisfaction and switching intentions. In addition to the practical implications of these results, the finding that satiation directly impacts service quality represents an important step in the overall task of understanding the effects of satiation in determining restaurant patronage behavior.

      "Abstract Note" : "A number of studies have revealed that low birth weight children have a heightened risk of various maladaptive outcomes, including academic challenges and delinquent involvement. However, very little research to date has examined whether the relationship between low birth weight, poor academic performance, and delinquent peer affiliation is moderated by genetic risk. Using data from the National Longitudinal study of Adolescent Health, the present study examines whether male adolescents born at very low birth weights are significantly predisposed to poor academic performance and delinquent peer affiliation. Moreover, we test whether the effect of birth weight on these outcomes is conditioned by level of genetic risk. We find no evidence that very low birth weight males are more likely to affiliate with delinquent peers or perform poorly in school during adolescence. However, upon examining gene-environment interactions, we find that being born at a very low birth weight does significantly increase the odds of poor academic performance and delinquent peer affiliation among males who possess a higher level of genetic risk. Limitations are noted and the implications of the findings are discussed.",

Since winning the US$700 million RTTT funding in 2010, the Florida Department of Education and districts have been promoting lesson study as one of the statewide vehicles to implement the state standards aligned with the Common Core State Standards. This study analyzed the state and districts' approaches to promote lesson study using policy documents, statewide district survey data, and interviews. We found that a majority of districts mandated lesson study implementation without securing or spending sufficient funding. In addition, the existing organizational structures and routines for professional development pose a major challenge in capacity building of district leaders and teachers to engage in lesson study.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Oral administration of anticancer agents presents a series of advantages for patients. However, most of the anticancer drugs have poor water solubility leading to low bioavailability. Controlled released spray dried matrix system of Gefitinib with hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin, chitosan, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, vitamin E TPGS, succinic acid were used for the design of formulations to improve the oral absorption of Gefitinib. Spray drying with a customized spray gun which allows simultaneous/pulsatile flow of two different liquid systems through single nozzle was used to prepare Gefitinib spray dried formulations (Gef-SD). Formulation was characterized by in vitro drug release and Caco-2 permeability studies. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in Sprague Dawley rats. Efficacy of Gef-SD was carried out in A431 xenografts models in nude mice. In Gef-SD group 9.14-fold increase in the AUC was observed compared to free Gef. Improved pharmacokinetic profile of Gef-SD translated into increase (1.75 fold compared to Gef free drug) in anticancer effects. Animal survival was significantly increased in Gef formulation treated groups, with superior reduction in the tumor size (1.48-fold) and volumes (1.75-fold) and also increase in the anticancer effects (TUNEL positive apoptotic cells) was observed in Gef-SD treated groups. Further, western blot, immunohistochemical and proteomics analysis demonstrated the increased pharmacodynamic effects of Gef-SD formulations in A431 xenograft tumor models. Our studies suggested that Gefitinib can be successfully incorporated into control release microparticles based oral formulation with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity. This study demonstrates the novel application of Gef in A431 tumor models.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Oxytocin (Oxt) is released in various hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain areas in response to anxiogenic stimuli to regulate aspects of emotionality and stress coping. We examined the anxiolytic action of Oxt in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) while appraising if Oxt recruits GABA neurons to inhibit the behavioral, hormonal, and neuronal response to stress in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Voles received an injection of Oxt in the PVN either before or after an elevated platform stress to determine a time-course for the effects of Oxt on the hormonal stress response. Subsequently, we evaluated if ante-stress injections of Oxt affected anxiety-like behaviors as well as neuronal activity in the PVN, using real-time in-vivo retrodialysis and immunohistochemistry with c-Fos expression as a biomarker of neural activity. In addition, we exposed voles to Oxt and a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, concurrently, to evaluate the impact of pharmacological blockade of GABAA receptors on the anxiolytic effects of Oxt. Elevated platform stress amplified anxiety-like behaviors and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity-catalyzing corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuronal activity and augmenting corticosterone release in circulation. Ante-stress Oxt injections in the PVN blocked these stress effects while promoting PVN GABA activity and release. Post-stress Oxt treatments were ineffective. The anxiolytic effects of Oxt were hindered by concurrent pharmacological blockade of GABA(A) receptors. Together, our data demonstrate ante-stress treatments of Oxt in the PVN inhibit stress activation of the HPA axis through recruitment of GABAergic neurons, providing insights to the local circuitry and potential therapeutically-relevant mechanisms.

      "Abstract Note" : "This study explores the impact of school gender culture in the United States on boys' and girls' attachment to school and symptoms of depression. We consider multiple dimensions of school gender culture and hypothesize that student subjective well-being is lower in schools with a lower percentage of females, stronger orientations toward marriage, more prevalent contact sports, and a student body that engages more often in fighting and drinking. xThe hypotheses are derived from theories of gendered organizations, heteronormativity, and hypermasculinity. Analyses of a national sample of middle and high school students in the U.S. (5,847 girls, 5,347 boys) from the 1994-95 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health show considerable variation in school gender cultures, and regression analyses yield some support for the hypotheses. A higher proportion of female students is associated with fewer depressive symptoms among girls as predicted, but weaker school attachment for boys. The results more consistently supported the hypotheses that student well-being suffers in schools where more classmates get into fights or get drunk. Finally, we find no evidence that student subjective well-being is affected by contexts in which marital plans are more prevalent or greater proportions of students play collision contact sports. We find some evidence that school gender composition and school contexts of fighting and drinking are consequential for student subjective well-being. We reject the hypothesis that school levels of marriage orientations and contact sports participation undermine student well-being. Overall, more work is needed in the conceptualization and measurement of school gender cultures.",

This approach is illustrated with a pilot study of institutional rules in municipal charters that define the roles and duties of mayors. The findings reveal that city charters exhibit great institutional diversity, particularly within strong mayor cities. We conclude with a research agenda that could generate a more precise and rigorous understanding of the relationship between the different configurations of institutions of city charters and the politics, governance, and performance of municipalities.",

Simulated summer crop (maize) yields were lower in the warm than the cold period, but also low during a neutral period. Simulated winter crop (wheat) yields were higher during the neutral period than during the warm and cold periods. A higher average temperature of a given period did not necessarily translate to lower crop yields. Specifically, the summer crop (maize) experienced about 7 % reduction in growing season length per degree increase in mean air temperature, and about 5 % for the winter (wheat) crop. Overall, the simulated maize yield was reduced by 13 % and wheat yield by 6.5 % per unit of increase temperature. In conclusion, simulated yield reduction per unit increase in mean temperature was reduced during the neutral period for the summer while for the winter crop there were fewer differences between the warm and neutral periods. The summer crop was sensitive to changes of mean growing season temperatures while the winter crops was sensitive to changes in CO2.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Dietary specialists tend to be less susceptible to the effects of chemical defenses produced by their prey compared to generalist predators that feed upon a broader range of prey species. While many researchers have investigated the ability of insects to detoxify dietary allelochemicals, little research has been conducted in marine ecosystems. We investigated metabolic detoxification pathways in three species of butterflyfishes: the hard coral specialist feeder, Chaetodon multicinctus, and two generalist feeders, Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon kleinii. Each species was fed tissue homogenate of the hard coral Porites lobata or the feeding deterrent compound homarine (found in the coral extract), and the expression and catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-like and CYP2-like enzymes were examined after one-week of treatment. The P. lobata homogenate significantly induced content and catalytic activity of CYP2-like and CYP3A-like forms, by 2-3 fold and by 3-9 fold, respectively, in C. multicinctus. Homarine caused a significant decrease of CYP2-like and CYP3A-like proteins at the high dose in C. kleinii and 60-80% mortality in that species. Homarine also induced CYP3A-like content by 3-fold and catalytic activity by 2-fold in C. auriga, while causing non-monotonic increases in CYP2-like and CYP3A-like catalytic activity in C. multicinctus. Our results indicate that dietary exposure to coral homogenates and the feeding deterrent constituent within these homogenates caused species-specific modulation of detoxification enzymes consistent with the prey selection strategies of generalist and specialist butterflyfishes.

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent meta-analyses on video game interventions with the aim to improve cognition have shown promise for both younger and older adults. Most studies suggest that fast-paced action games produce the largest benefits, but previous work has shown that older adults might not necessarily adhere to interventions using action games. To increase intervention adherence, we investigated older adult video game preferences that might bolster adherence by having participants play a competitive game (Mario Kart DS) or a cooperative game (Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga) alone or with a partner. Although hypotheses regarding cooperative and multiplayer gameplay were not supported, converging evidence suggests multiplayer gameplay may lead to greater enjoyment, which has been previously shown to be related to intervention adherence. Insights for gaming intervention studies in older populations are also provided.",

PHIL simulations are an advanced application of real-time simulations that represent novel methods, which conjoin software and hardware testing. This contribution outlines necessary requirements for the implementation of PHIL simulations, which are defined by the nature of the digital real-time simulator, the power amplifier, and the power interface (PI). Fundamental characteristics, such as the input/ output systems, PI, interface algorithm, and system stability considerations, are discussed for PHIL setups, in order to illustrate both flexibility and complexity of this compound simulation method. The objective of this work is to elaborate an understandable overview of PHIL simulation for electrical power systems and to constitute a contemporary state-of-the-art status of this research area.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Previous research shows that powerful people are more likely than those lacking power to engage in infidelity. One possible explanation holds (a) that power psychologically releases people from the inhibiting effects of social norms and thus increases their appetite for counter-normative forms of sexuality. Two alternative explanations are (b) that power increases appetite for any form of sexuality, normative or counternormative, and (c) that power makes men (but not women) seem more attractive to others and thus increases their access to potential mating opportunities. The current research tested these explanations using correlational data from 610 Dutch men and women. Supporting the first explanation, power's relationship with infidelity was statistically mediated by increased attraction to the secrecy associated with infidelity. Inconsistent with the second explanation, power was linked with infidelity but not with casual sex among singles (a more normative form of sexuality). Inconsistent with the third explanation, the link between power and infidelity was observed just as strongly in women as in men. Findings suggest that power may be associated with infidelity because power draws people to the counternormative aspects of infidelity. Implications for theories of power, sexuality, and gender are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The results of this research suggest a new mandate for discriminant validity testing in marketing. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that the AVE-SV comparison (Fornell and Larcker 1981) and HTMT ratio (Henseler et al. 2015) with 0.85 cutoff provide the best assessment of discriminant validity and should be the standard for publication in marketing. These conclusions are based on a thorough assessment of the literature and the results of a Monte Carlo simulation. First, based on a content analysis of articles published in seven leading marketing journals from 1996 to 2012, the authors demonstrate that three tests-the constrained phi (Joreskog 1971), AVE-SV (Fornell and Larcker 1981), and overlapping confidence intervals (Anderson and Gerbing 1988)-are by far most common. Further review reveals that (1) more than 20% of survey-based and over 80% of non-survey-based marketing studies fail to document tests for discriminant validity, (2) there is wide variance across journals and research streams in terms of whether discriminant validity tests are performed, (3) conclusions have already been drawn about the relative stringency of the three most common methods, and (4) the method that is generally perceived to be most generous is being consistently misapplied in a way that erodes its stringency. Second, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to assess the relative rigor of the three most common tests, as well as an emerging technique (HTMT). Results reveal that (1) on average, the four discriminant validity testing methods detect violations approximately 50% of the time, (2) the constrained phi and overlapping confidence interval approaches perform very poorly in detecting violations whereas the AVE-SV test and HTMT (with a ratio cutoff of 0.85) methods perform well, and (3) the HTMT.85 method offers the best balance between high detection and low arbitrary violation (i.e., false positive) rates.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background. A history of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) is consistently cited as one of the strongest predictors of future suicidal behavior. However, stark discrepancies in the literature raise questions about the true magnitude of these associations. The objective of this study is to examine the magnitude and clinical utility of the associations between SITBs and subsequent suicide ideation, attempts, and death. Method. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar for papers published through December 2014. Inclusion required that studies include at least one longitudinal analysis predicting suicide ideation, attempts, or death using any SITB variable. We identified 2179 longitudinal studies; 172 met inclusion criteria. Results. The most common outcome was suicide attempt (47.80%), followed by death (40.50%) and ideation (11.60%). Median follow-up was 52 months (mean = 82.52, S.D. = 102.29). Overall prediction was weak, with weighted mean odds ratios (ORs) of 2.07 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76-2.43] for ideation, 2.14 (95% CI 2.00-2.30) for attempts, and 1.54 (95% CI 1.39-1.71) for death. Adjusting for publication bias further reduced estimates. Diagnostic accuracy analyses indicated acceptable specificity (86-87%) and poor sensitivity (10-26%), with areas under the curve marginally above chance (0.60-0.62). Most risk factors generated OR estimates of <2.0 and no risk factor exceeded 4.5. Effects were consistent regardless of sample severity, sample age groups, or follow-up length. Conclusions. Prior SITBs confer risk for later suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, they only provide a marginal improvement in diagnostic accuracy above chance. Addressing gaps in study design, assessment, and underlying mechanisms may prove useful in improving prediction and prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives: The purpose of this research was to develop the Sport Commitment Questionnaire-2 (SCQ-2) and establish its psychometric properties. The SCQ-2 measures the updated Sport Commitment Model (SCM: Scanlan, Russell, Scanlan, Klunchoo, & Chow, 2013) and replaces the outdated Sport Commitment Questionnaire (SCQ) that assessed the original SCM (Scanlan, Simons, Carpenter, Schmidt, & Keeler, 1993). Design: Based on prior commitment research, items were generated to refine and expand the original SCQ subscales and to measure new candidate constructs to the SCM. A multiphase study was then conducted. Methods: Phase 1 participants were 753 male/female adolescent athletes (ages 13-19 years) from six sports representing varying levels of task interdependence. Using similar methodology as Phase 1, Phase 2 assessed 982 male/female adolescent athletes. Results: Exploratory factor analysis of Phase I data revealed 13 factors: two types of commitment (Enthusiastic and Constrained) and 11 sources. Confirmatory factor analysis of Phase 2 data supported a 58-item, 12-factor structure. In addition, all subscales were internally consistent. Structural equation modeling revealed that the sources explained 81.8% of the variance in Enthusiastic Commitment and 63.9% in Constrained Commitment. Conclusions: The SCQ-2 assesses the sources and types of commitment in the updated SCM. Based on several indices of fit and the composite reliabilities, psychometric support for the SCQ-2 was established. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We study the problem of classifying actions of human subjects using depth movies generated by Kinect or other depth sensors. Representing human body as dynamical skeletons, we study the evolution of their (skeletons') shapes as trajectories on Kendall's shape manifold. The action data is typically corrupted by large variability in execution rates within and across subjects and, thus, causing major problems in statistical analyses. To address that issue, we adopt a recently-developed framework of Su et al. [1], [2] to this problem domain. Here, the variable execution rates correspond to re-parameterizations of trajectories, and one uses a parameterization-invariant metric for aligning, comparing, averaging, and modeling trajectories. This is based on a combination of transported square-root vector fields (TSRVFs) of trajectories and the standard Euclidean norm, that allows computational efficiency. We develop a comprehensive suite of computational tools for this application domain: smoothing and denoising skeleton trajectories using median filtering, up-and down-sampling actions in time domain, simultaneous temporal-registration of multiple actions, and extracting invertible Euclidean representations of actions. Due to invertibility these Euclidean representations allow both discriminative and generative models for statistical analysis. For instance, they can be used in a SVM-based classification of original actions, as demonstrated here using MSR Action-3D, MSR Daily Activity and 3D Action Pairs datasets. Using only the skeletal information, we achieve state-of-the-art classification results on these datasets.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper describes a novel framework for computing geodesic paths in shape spaces of spherical surfaces under an elastic Riemannian metric. The novelty lies in defining this Riemannian metric directly on the quotient ( shape) space, rather than inheriting it from pre-shape space, and using it to formulate a path energy that measures only the normal components of velocities along the path. In other words, this paper defines and solves for geodesics directly on the shape space and avoids complications resulting from the quotient operation. This comprehensive framework is invariant to arbitrary parameterizations of surfaces along paths, a phenomenon termed as gauge invariance. Additionally, this paper makes a link between different elastic metrics used in the computer science literature on one hand, and the mathematical literature on the other hand, and provides a geometrical interpretation of the terms involved. Examples using real and simulated 3D objects are provided to help illustrate the main ideas.",

      "Abstract Note" : "One-step direct laser writing (DLW) method has been applied to fabricate flexible and conductive graphitic porous patterns or arrays from polyimide. With assistance of electron microscopy, Raman and energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, and the coupled electrical and mechanical test, a systematic processing-structure-property relationship study was performed to investigate the effect of laser power and scanning speed on the piezoresistive performance of the DLW generated graphitic sensor or sensor arrays. Within the range of processing conditions being studied, the sensor gauge factor showed an exponential dependence on the ratio of the laser power to the scanning speed. This finding allowed for the achievement of a high gauge factor of similar to 112. Lastly, the versatility of the one-step DLW generated graphitic sensors were demonstrated in different sensing applications, which include strain mapping of the high-performance polymeric composites, flexible and wearable sensor for gesture registration and man-machine interactions.

      "Abstract Note" : "Acquiring instant vehicle speed is desirable and a corner stone to many important vehicular applications. This paper utilizes smartphone sensors to estimate the vehicle speed, especially when GPS is unavailable or inaccurate in urban environments. In particular, we estimate the vehicle speed by integrating the accelerometer's readings over time and find the acceleration errors can lead to large deviations between the estimated speed and the real one. Further analysis shows that the changes of acceleration errors are very small over time which can be corrected at some points, called reference points, where the true vehicle speed can be estimated. Recognizing this observation, we propose an accurate vehicle speed estimation system, SenSpeed, which senses natural driving conditions in urban environments including making turns, stopping, and passing through uneven road surfaces, to derive reference points and further eliminates the speed estimation deviations caused by acceleration errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SenSpeed is accurate and robust in real driving environments. On average, the real- time speed estimation error on local road is 2:1km/h, and the offline speed estimation error is as low as 1:21km/h. Whereas the average error of GPS is 5: 0 and 4:5km/h, respectively.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Social media (SM) pervades our society. One rapidly growing application of SM is its use in personnel decision making. Organizations are increasingly searching SM (e.g., Facebook) to gather information about potential employees. In this article, we suggest that organizational practice has outpaced the scientific study of SM assessments in an area that has important consequences for individuals (e.g., being selected for work), organizations (e.g., successfully predicting job performance or withdrawal), and society (e.g., consequent adverse impact/diversity). We draw on theory and research from various literatures to advance a research agenda that addresses this gap between practice and research. Overall, we believe this is a somewhat rare moment in the human resources literature when a new class of selection methods arrives on the scene, and we urge researchers to help understand the implications of using SM assessments for personnel decisions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In recent articles published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Mark Springer and John Gatesy (S&G) present numerous criticisms of recent implementations and testing of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model in phylogenomics, popularly known as \"species tree\" methods. After pointing out errors in alignments and gene tree rooting in recent phylogenomic data sets, particularly in Song et al. (2012) on mammals and Xi et al. (2014) on plants, they suggest that these errors seriously compromise the conclusions of these studies. Additionally, S&G enumerate numerous perceived violated assumptions and deficiencies in the application of the MSC model in phylogenomics, such as its assumption of neutrality and in particular the use of transcriptomes, which are deemed inappropriate for the MSC because the constituent exons often subtend large regions of chromosomes within which recombination is substantial. We acknowledge these previously reported errors in recent phylogenomic data sets, but disapprove of S&G's excessively combative and taunting tone. We show that these errors, as well as two nucleotide sorting methods used in the analysis of Arrtborella, have little impact on the conclusions of those papers. Moreover, several concepts introduced by S&G and an appeal to \"first principles\" of phylogenetics in an attempt to discredit MSC models are invalid and reveal numerous misunderstandings of the MSC. Contrary to the claims of S&G we show that recent computer simulations used to test the robustness of MSC models are not circular and do not unfairly favor MSC models over concatenation. In fact, although both concatenation and MSC models clearly perform well in regions of tree space with long branches and little incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), simulations reveal the erratic behavior of concatenation when subjected to data subsampling and its tendency to produce spuriously confident yet conflicting results in regions of parameter space where MSC models still perform well. S&G's claims that MSC models explain little or none (0-15%) of the observed gene tree heterogeneity observed in a mammal data set and that MSC models assume ILS as the only source of gene tree variation are flawed. Overall many of their criticisms of MSC models are invalidated when concatenation is appropriately viewed as a special case of the MSC, which in turn is a special case of emerging network models in phylogenomics. We reiterate that there is enormous promise and value in recent implementations and tests of the MSC and look forward to its increased use and refinement in phylogenomics. (C) 2015 The Authors.

      "Abstract Note" : "In most mammals, the Zfp36 gene family consists of three conserved members, with a fourth member, Zfp36l3, present only in rodents. The ZFP36 proteins regulate post-transcriptional gene expression at the level of mRNA stability in organisms from humans to yeasts, and appear to be expressed in all major groups of eukaryotes. In Mus musculus, Zfp36l3 expression is limited to the placenta and yolk sac, and is important for overall fecundity. We sequenced the Zfp36l3 gene from more than 20 representative species, from members of the Muridae, Cricetidae and Nesomyidae families. Zfp36l3 was not present in Dipodidae, or any families that branched earlier, indicating that this gene is exclusive to the Muroidea superfamily. We provide evidence that Zfp36l3 arose by retrotransposition of an mRNA encoded by a related gene, Zfp36l2 into an ancestral rodent X chromosome. Zfp36l3 has evolved rapidly since its origin, and numerous modifications have developed, including variations in start codon utilization, de nova intron formation by mechanisms including a nested retrotransposition, and the insertion of distinct repetitive regions. One of these repeat regions, a long alanine rich-sequence, is responsible for the full-time cytoplasmic localization of Mus musculus ZFP36L3. In contrast, this repeat sequence is lacking in Peromyscus maniculatus ZFP36L3, and this protein contains a novel nuclear export sequence that controls shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol. Zfp36l3 is an example of a recently acquired, rapidly evolving gene, and its various orthologues illustrate several different mechanisms by which new genes emerge and evolve.

The current research demonstrates that biased sex ratios (greater numbers of one sex than the other) influence fundamental aspects of people's mating strategy. When the sex ratio was favorable (one's own sex was in the minority), both sexes adopted strong sex-typical sociosexual orientations (relatively restricted for women; relatively unrestricted for men). When the sex ratio was unfavorable (one's own sex was in the majority), both sexes shifted toward the orientation typically favored by the other sex: Women became more unrestricted and men became more restricted (Experiment 1). When the sex ratio was unfavorable (relative to favorable), participants also displayed greater aggression toward a romantically desirable (but not undesirable) same-sex partner (Experiment 2). Exploratory analyses suggested that the sex ratio effect was present for unprovoked aggression but not provoked aggression (given the exploratory nature of that analysis, the aggression effect should be considered with some caution). Findings suggest that people's mating strategies are adaptively calibrated to contingencies within the local mating ecology.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: The current study presents initial support for the construct validity of Acute Suicidal Affective Disturbance (ASAD), a clinical entity consisting of acute suicide risk and several related features. Methods: Participants (N=195) were university students who were recruited for a history of suicide attempt(s), history of suicidal ideation, or no history of suicide attempts or suicidal ideation. Participants completed study measures online. Results: Factor analytic results indicated a one factor solution for a lifetime measure of ASAD symptoms. The measure demonstrated strong convergent and divergent validity with common correlates of suiciderelated outcomes and incremental predictive validity, as lifetime occurrence of ASAD symptoms predicted number of past suicide attempts above and beyond a host of suicide risk factors. Lifetime ASAD symptoms differed between those with multiple suicide attempts, those with a single attempt, and participants without a history of attempts, as well as between participants with a history of both suicidal ideation and attempts and those with a history of suicidal ideation but not suicide attempts. Limitations: The cross-sectional research design limits the ability to infer causation between ASAD symptoms and suicidal behavior. Only past ASAD symptoms (not current symptoms) were measured. Conclusions: ASAD appears to be a unified clinical entity that characterizes acute suicide risk which may assist clinicians in determining a client's potential for death by suicide.

Using the construction-integration model of text comprehension as an overarching theoretical framework, we examined direct and mediated relations of foundational cognitive skills (working memory and attention), foundational language skills (vocabulary and grammatical knowledge), and higher-order cognitive skills (inference, theory of mind, and comprehension monitoring) to listening comprehension. A total of 201 first grade children in South Korea participated in the study. Structural equation modeling results showed that listening comprehension is directly predicted by working memory, grammatical knowledge, inference, and theory of mind and is indirectly predicted by attention, vocabulary, and comprehension monitoring. The total effects were .46 for working memory, .07 for attention, .30 for vocabulary, .49 for grammatical knowledge, .31 for inference, .52 for theory of mind, and .18 for comprehension monitoring. These results suggest that multiple language and cognitive skills make contributions to listening comprehension, and their contributions are both direct and indirect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract Note" : "The conglomerate organizational structure of health insurers suggests two distinct methods of product diversification - the first is firm-level diversification, or diversification within individual affiliates, and the second is conglomerate-level diversification, or diversification across affiliates of the conglomerate. We hypothesize that using both firm- and conglomerate-level diversification may magnify the costs or benefits of diversification on the financial performance of the conglomerate. Our results confirm this hypothesis and suggest a positive relation between health insurer financial performance and the use of both product line diversification methods. Our results not only contribute to the body of literature related to corporate diversification but are also important to policymakers and all health insurance market participants as portions of the Affordable Care Act continue to be implemented.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The role of interfacial contamination on antiphase domain boundary (APB) formation in GaAs grown epitaxially on Si(100) by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition was investigated. The pre-growth cleaning of the Si substrate was varied to affect the relative amount of residual surface contamination across the wafer. APB density in the as-grown GaAs film was examined with the aid of a selective APB etchant. The interfacial oxygen and carbon concentrations were determined using secondary ion mass spectrometry. It was found that the APB density increased significantly from 0.14 to 3.2 mu m(-1) between the center and the edge of the wafer. Over this distance, the integrated carbon concentration at the GaAs/Si interface increased by an order of magnitude and the integrated oxygen concentration, although two orders of magnitude lower than carbon, also increased by a factor of six. Analysis of the GaAs/Si interface with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy showed a direct association of APBs with amorphous interfacial particles. The particles are likely carbon-based, possibly SiC, and thus residual carbon contamination is believed to be the primary contributor to increased APB formation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper proposes a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system consisting of modular current-fed dual-active-bridge (CF-DAB) dc-dc converter with cascaded multilevel inverter. The proposed converter allows a small dc-link capacitor in the three-phase wye-connected PV system; therefore, the system reliability can be improved by replacing electrolytic capacitors with film capacitors. The low-frequency ripple-free maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is also realized in the proposed converter. First of all, to minimize the influence resulting from reduced capacitance, a dc-link voltage synchronizing control is developed. Then, a detailed design of power mitigation control based on CF-DAB dynamic model is presented to prevent the large low-frequency voltage variation propagating from the dc-link to PV side. Finally, a novel variable step-size MPPT algorithm is proposed to ensure not only high MPPT efficiency, but also fast maximum power extraction under rapid irradiation change. A downscaled 5-kW PV converter module with a small dc-link capacitor was built in the laboratory with the proposed control and MPPT algorithm, and experimental results are given to validate the converter performance.",

However, complex models of interacting and bootstrapping effects of SK, SR, instruction, and reading hypothesize reciprocal effects. Testing this lattice model with children (n=852) followed from first to second grade (5.9-10.4years of age) revealed reciprocal effects for reading and SR, and reading and SK, but not SR and SK. More effective literacy instruction reduced reading stability over time. Findings elucidate the synergistic and reciprocal effects of learning to read on other important linguistic, self-regulatory, and cognitive processes; the value of using complex models of development to inform intervention design; and how learned skills may influence development during middle childhood.",

This investigation asks whether and how the structure of vocabulary knowledge affects language processing in English-learning 24-month-old children (N=32; 18 F, 14 M). Parental vocabulary report was used to calculate semantic density in several early-acquired semantic categories. Performance on two language-processing tasks (lexical recognition and sentence processing) was compared as a function of semantic density. In both tasks, real-time comprehension was facilitated for higher density items, whereas lower density items experienced more interference. The findings indicate that language-processing skills develop heterogeneously and are influenced by the semantic network surrounding a known word.",

Design and SampleA cross-sectional secondary analysis from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provided the sample of AA (N=377) and White (N=971) men over the age of 40years. Regression analysis with confidence intervals was utilized to examine the factors associated with AA and White men receiving PCS. The Social Ecological Model provided the theoretical framework. MeasuresQuestionnaires from the NHANES dataset provided data for this study. Results: Age, education, and access to health care was associated with AA and White men receiving the DRE. Income and church attendance was only associated with White men receiving the DRE. Only White men had an association of income with receiving the PSA test and only AA men had an association of marital status with receiving the PSA test. ConclusionsCultural evaluations of PCS behaviors among AA men are necessary to decrease the health disparity of prostate cancer among the AA population.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The dichromium(III)-containing heteropoly-16-tungstates [Cr-2(III)(B-beta-(SiW8O31)-W-IV)(2)](14-) (1) and [Cr-2(III)(B-beta-(GeW8O31)-W-IV)(2)](14-) (2) were prepared via a one-pot reaction of the composing elements in aqueous, basic medium. Polyanions 1 and 2 represent the first examples of Cr-III-containing heteropolytungstates comprising the octatungstate unit {XW8O31} (X = Si, Ge). Magnetic studies demonstrated that, in the solid state, the two polyanions exhibit a weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the two Cr-III centers with J = -3.5 +/- 0.5 cm(-1), with no long-range ordering down to 1.8 K. The ground-state spin of polyanions 1 and 2 was thus deduced to be 0, but the detection of a complex set of EPR signals implies that there are thermally accessible excited states containing unpaired spins resulting from the two S = 3/2 Cr-III ions. A comprehensive electrochemistry study on 1 and 2 in solution was performed, and biological tests showed that both polyanions display significant antidiabetic and anticancer activities.",

An anhydrous solid [Ce(Bn-BTzBP)(NO3)(3)] (Bn = benzene) complex was synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Eu(III) complexes with the 2-ethyl(hexyl) derivative EH-BTzBP in methanol were studied by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Earlier studies have identified the EH-BTzBP as a potentially useful solvent extraction reagent for the separation of americium from lanthanide metal ions, a challenging component of advanced nuclear fuel cycles for actinide transmutation. To help identify species formed in the extraction process, the influence of 2-bromohexanoic acid (identified as an essential component of the separation system) on Eu(III) complexes was investigated. Comparison with an organic phase after extraction of Eu(III) by EH-BTzBP and 2-bromohexanoic acid showed that both 1:1 and 1:2 (Eu/EH-BTzBP) complexes are involved in the extraction. UV-visible spectrophotometry was used to compare Eu(III) stability constants with those of other Ln(III) complexes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The crystal structure, magnetic properties, heat capacity, and Raman spectra of double-perovskite M2AgF4 (M = K, K3/4Rb1/4, K1/2Rb1/2, K1/4Rb3/4, and Rb) phases have been examined, adding to the body of previous results for the M = Na, Cs derivatives. The results suggest that double-perovskite K2AgF4 adopts a disordered orthorhombic Bmab structure with an antiferrodistortive arrangement of the elongated and tilted [AgF6] octahedra rather than the structure with the ferrodistortive arrangement of compressed octahedra, as suggested previously (Mazej, Z.; Goreshnik, Jaglicic, Z.; Gawel, B.; Lasocha, W.; Grzybowska, D.; Jaron, T.; Kurzydlowski, D.; Malinowski, P.

CrystEngComm 2009, 11, 1702-1710). A re-examination of the previously collected single-crystal X-ray diffraction data confirms the current structure assignment, and it is also in agreement with recent theoretical calculations. High field electron paramagnetic resonance spectra reaffirm the presence of elongated [AgF6] octahedra in the crystal structure of all M2AgF4 phases studied. The local structure of the M = K derivative is most complex, with regions of the sample that are quite orthorhombically distorted, whereas other regions more closely resemble the tetragonal phase. The mixed-cation K/Rb phases are also inhomogeneous, containing regions of the pure K compound and regions of another high-symmetry phase (likely tetragonal) of a mixed (Rb-richer) compound with unknown composition. The temperature-resolved phase diagram of all K/Rb phases has been established and positioned within the entire M = Na, K, Rb, Cs series.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objectives/HypothesisTo present an overview of the barriers to the implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in thyroid cancer management and to introduce a computer-based clinical support system. Data SourcesPubMed. Review Methods: A review of studies on adherence to CPGs was conducted. ResultsAwareness and adoption of CPGs is low in thyroid cancer management. Barriers to implementation include unfamiliarity with the CPGs and financial concerns. Effective interventions to improve adherence are possible, especially when they are readily accessible at the point of care delivery. Computerized clinical support systems show particular promise. The authors introduce the clinical decision making modules (CDMMs) of the Thyroid Cancer Care Collaborative, a thyroid cancer-specific electronic health record. These computer-based modules can assist clinicians with implementation of these recommendations in clinical practice. ConclusionComputer-based support systems can help clinicians understand and adopt the thyroid cancer CPGs. By integrating patient characteristics and guidelines at the point of care delivery, the CDMMs can improve adherence to the guidelines and help clinicians provide high-quality, evidence-based, and individualized patient care in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer.

Using a within-group design, we examined adolescent's well-being related to parental absence, school and neighbourhood transitions, paygrade/rank and participation in military-sponsored activities, and differentiated outcomes by sex and age. Two parental work factors primarily influenced adolescent's well-being, parental paygrade/rank and engagement in military-sponsored activities. Parental paygrade/rank was the only factor uniformly related to poorer well-being, and this variable likely represents a more complex set of family circumstances. Engaging in military-sponsored activities served as a resource and was related to enhanced well-being. Individual-level differences and implications for social workers are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent research suggests that infants tend to add words to their vocabulary that are semantically related to other known words, though it is not clear why this pattern emerges. In this paper, we explore whether infants leverage their existing vocabulary and semantic knowledge when interpreting novel label-object mappings in real time. We initially identified categorical domains for which individual 24-month-old infants have relatively higher and lower levels of knowledge, irrespective of overall vocabulary size. Next, we taught infants novel words in these higher and lower knowledge domains and then asked if their subsequent real-time recognition of these items varied as a function of their category knowledge. While our participants successfully acquired the novel label-object mappings in our task, there were important differences in the way infants recognized these words in real time. Namely, infants showed more robust recognition of high (vs. low) domain knowledge words. These findings suggest that dense semantic structure facilitates early word learning and real-time novel word recognition.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BackgroundResearch regarding suicide mortality among firefighters within the U.S. has been sparse and has yielded inconsistent findings. This study aimed to: (i) describe suicide rates within a large, urban fire department; and (ii) compare firefighter suicide rates with demographically adjusted general population suicide rates. MethodsRosters were obtained from the Philadelphia Fire Department (PFD) for all members employed by or separated from the department between 1993 and 2014 (N=4,395). Vital statistics for each member were obtained from the CDC's National Death Index. ResultsOverall, 272 deaths were recorded; 11 (4.0%) were certified as suicides. The overall suicide rate among firefighter affiliates of the PFD between 1993 and 2014 was 11.61 per 100,000 person-years. ConclusionsThe suicide rate among firefighters appears comparable to, and perhaps lower than, demographically adjusted general population estimates. Infrastructure to triangulate and monitor suicide rates from multiple departments, both career and volunteer, is needed to derive a more representative and informative estimate of firefighter suicide rates.

      "Abstract Note" : "Temperature profoundly affects the perceived intensity of taste, yet we know little of the extent of temperature's effect on taste in the peripheral nervous system. Accordingly, we investigated the influence of temperature from 23 degrees C to 43 degrees C in 4 degrees C intervals on the integrated responses of the chorda tympani (CT) nerve to a large series of chemical stimuli representing sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami tastes in C57BL/J6 mice. We also measured neural responses to NaCl, Na-gluconate, Na-acetate, Na-sulfate, and MSG with and without 5 mu M benzamil, an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) antagonist, to assess the influence of temperature on ENaC-dependent and ENaC-independent response components. Our results showed that for most stimuli (0.5 M sucrose, glucose, fructose, and maltose; 0.02 M saccharin and sucralose; 0.5 M NaCl, Na-gluconate, Na-acetate, Na-sulfate, KCl, K-gluconate, K-acetate, and K-sulfate; 0.05 M citric acid, acetic acid, and HCl; 0.1 M MSG and 0.05 M quinine hydrochloride: QHCl), CT response magnitudes were maximal between 35 degrees C and 39 degrees C and progressively smaller at cooler or warmer temperatures. In contrast, the weakest responses to NH4Cl, (NH4)(2)SO4, and K-sulfate were at the lowest temperature, with response magnitude increasing monotonically with increasing temperature, while the largest responses to acetic acid were at the lowest temperature, with response magnitude decreasing with increasing temperature. The response to sweet and umami stimuli across temperatures were similar reflecting the involvement of TRPM5 activity, in contrast to bitter stimuli, which were weakly affected by temperature. Temperature-modulated responses to salts and acids most likely operate through mechanisms independent of ENaC and TRPM5.",

      "Abstract Note" : "IntroductionTOBI((R)) Podhaler is a capsule-based drug-device combination (tobramycin inhalation powder [TIP] 28mg capsules via unit-dose dry powder T-326 Inhaler [Podhaler]) developed for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). We explored how inspiratory flow profiles and mouth-throat geometries affect drug delivery with the T-326 Inhaler. MethodsInspiratory flow profiles were recorded from 38 subjects aged 6-71 who had CF and varying degrees of lung function impairment. Ten of the inspiratory flow profiles were simulated in the laboratory using a custom breath simulator to determine delivered dose (DD) from the T-326 Inhaler. In vitro total lung dose (TLDin vitro) was measured using four anatomical throat models, ranging from a child to a large adult. ResultsAerosol performance was assessed across a range of inspiratory flow profiles. Mean DD ranged from 88.8% to 97.0% of declared capsule content. TLDin vitro ranged from 54.8% to 72.4% of capsule content between the flow profile/throat options tested, and the mean TLDin vitro across the range of flow profiles and anatomical throats tested was 635%. ConclusionsOur findings indicate that the T-326 Inhaler provides reliable drug delivery at flow rates likely to be achieved by a broad spectrum of patients with CF. Importantly, forceful inhalation was not required to achieve a robust TLDin vitro. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:1159-1167. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The promise of using games for learning is that play- and learning-engagement would occur cohesively as a whole to compose a highly motivated learning experience. Yet the conceptualization of such an integrative process in the development of play-based learning engagement is lacking. In this analytical paper, we explored and conceptualized the nature and development of game-based learning engagement via an iterative, two-stage analytical process. The first stage was theory driven. The literatures on motives of play, game and cognitive engagement, and game-based learning were reviewed and analyzed. Theoretical discussions on how learning engagement is activated and sustained during gameplay were distilled. The second stage was data driven. An in situ, multiple-case study was conducted to further examine affective and cognitive facets of learning engagement in gaming. The finding suggested that game-based learning engagement is an integrated and continuing process that advances from affective engagement driven by optimal challenge, cognitive engagement situated in playfulness, to potentially game-action-based content engagement.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect individual-and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2) characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social behavior in G. holbrooki.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Geometrical and electronic structures of the neutral and singly negatively charged Fe6On and Fe7Om clusters in the range of 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= m <= 24, respectively, are computed using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation. The largest clusters in the two series, Fe6O20 and Fe7O24, can be described as Fe(FeO4)(5) and Fe(FeO4)(6) or alternatively as [FeO5](FeO3)(5) and [FeO6](FeO3)(6), respectively. The Fe6O20 and Fe7O24 clusters possess adiabatic electron affinities (EA(ad)) of 5.64 eV and 5.80 eV and can be attributed to the class of hyperhalogens since FeO4 is an unique closed-shell superhalogen with the EA(ad) of 3.9 eV. The spin character of the lowest total energy states in both series changes from ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic when the first Fe-O-Fe bridge is formed. Oxidation decreases substantially the polarizability per atom of the initial bare clusters; namely, from 5.98 angstrom(3) of Fe-6 to 2.47 angstrom(3) of Fe6O20 and from 5.67 angstrom(3) of Fe-7 to 2.38 angstrom(3) of Fe7O24. The results of our computations pertaining to the binding energies of O, Fe, O-2, and FeO in the Fe7Om series provide an explanation for the experimentally observed abundance of the iron oxide nanoparticles with stoichiometric compositions.

The 2D unsteady supersonic underexpanded jet, impinging the flat plate in nonlinear oscillating mode, is used as the first test problem for both modes. Large memory savings for the propagator approximation are demonstrated. Corresponding prospects for the estimation of receptivity and singular vectors are discussed. The shallow water equations are used as the second large-scale test problem. Excellent results are obtained for the proposed optimized DMD method of the shallow water equations when compared with recent POD-based/discrete empirical interpolationbased model reduction results in the literature.

      "Abstract Note" : "Geometrical and electronic structures of the 3d-metal oxide clusters (FeO)(n), (CoO)(n), and (NiO)(n) are computed using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation in the range of 1 <= n <= 10. It is found that the cluster geometries are similar in the (FeO)(n) and (CoO)(n) series but noticeably different in the (NiO) n series for several values of n. All of the lowest total energy states are found to possess relatively small spin multiplicities and are either antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic except for the states of (NiO)(3), (NiO)(4), (NiO)(9), and (NiO)(10), which are ferromagnetic. The computed polarizabilities per atom undergo a steep decrease when compared to the atomic values of the MO monomers (M = Fe, Co, and Ni). Surprisingly, the polarizability does not strongly depend on either M or n in all the considered series when n varies from 3 to 10. The binding energies per atom are the largest in the (FeO)(n) series, followed by the binding energies of (CoO)(n) and (NiO)(n).",

      "Abstract Note" : "HIV-1 CA capsid protein possesses intrinsic conformational flexibility, which is essential for its assembly into conical capsids and interactions with host factors. CA is dynamic in the assembled capsid, and residues in functionally important regions of the protein undergo motions spanning many decades of time scales. Chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors, recorded in magic-angle-spinning NMR experiments, provide direct residue-specific probes of motions on nano- to microsecond time scales. We combined NMR, MD, and density-functional-theory calculations, to gain quantitative understanding of internal backbone dynamics in CA assemblies, and we found that the dynamically averaged 15N CSA tensors calculated by this joined protocol are in remarkable agreement with experiment. Thus, quantitative atomic-level understanding of the relationships between CSA tensors, local backbone structure, and motions in CA assemblies is achieved, demonstrating the power of integrating NMR experimental data and theory for characterizing atomic-resolution dynamics in biological systems.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Current high efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) rely on the incorporation of multiple chromophores, via either codeposition or preformed assemblies, as a means of increasing broad band light absorption. These strategies have some inherent limitations including decreased total light absorption by each of the dyes, low surface loadings, and complex synthetic procedures. In this report, we introduce an alternative strategy, self-assembled bilayers, as a simple, stepwise method of incorporating two complementary chromophores into a DSSC. The bilayer devices exhibit a 10% increase in J(sc), V-oc, and eta over the monolayer devices due to increased incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency across the entire visible spectrum and slowed recombination losses at the interface. Directional energy and electron transfer toward the metal oxide surface are key steps in the bilayer photon-to-current generation process. These results are important as they open the door to a new architecture for harnessing broadband light in dye-sensitized devices.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Halogen-bonding interactions have attracted increasing attention in various fields of molecular science. Here we report the first comprehensive study of halogen-bonding-utilized solid solution for simultaneous control of multifunctional properties. A series of anion-mixed molecular conductors (DIE-TSe)(2)MBr4Cl4(1-x) [DIETSe = diiodo(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene; M = Fe, Ga; 0 < x < 1] were synthesized without changing crystal structure utilizing strong halogen bonds between DIETSe molecules and anions. Detailed physical property measurements (T > 0.3 K, H < 35 T) using the single crystals demonstrated simultaneous control of both spin and charge degrees of freedom. The increase in Br content x gradually suppresses a metal-insulator transition attributed to the nesting instability of the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surfaces. It suggests the dimensionality of pi electrons is extended by increasing the anion size, which is opposite of the typical effect of chemical pressure. We found that the \"negative\" chemical pressure is associated with the characteristic halogen-bonding network. Br substitution also enhances the antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering of d-electron spins in the Fe salts, as indicated by the Neel temperature, AF phase boundary field, and saturation field. Furthermore, we observed hysteresis in both magnetization and resistivity only in halogen-mixed salts at very low temperatures, indicating simultaneous spin and charge manipulation by alloying.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To investigate the interplay between electronic structure and itinerant magnetism, Ca1-xEuxCo2As2 solid solutions (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) were prepared by reactions between constituent elements in molten Bi. All of the samples crystallize in the ThCr2Si2 structure type. The crystal structure refinement revealed the formation of Co vacancies, the concentration of which decreases as the Eu content increases. The Eu site exhibits mixed valence in all samples. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy revealed that the average Eu oxidation state decreases from +2.17 at 0 < x <= 0.6 to +2.14 at x >= 0.65. The same borderline behavior is observed in magnetic properties. The substitution of Eu for Ca causes the transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Co moments in CaCo2As2 to ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of Co moments in Ca1-xEuxCo2As2 with 0.1 <= x <= 0.6. At higher Eu content, AFM ordering of Eu moments is observed, whereas the Co sublattice exhibits only paramagnetic behavior. Single-crystal neutron diffraction studies revealed that both Co and Eu sublattices order FM in Ca0.5Eu0.5Co2As2 with the magnetic moments aligned along the tetragonal c axis. In the AFM phases with x >= 0.65, only Eu moments are ordered in a helical spin structure defined by an incommensurate propagation vector k = [00q], with the moment lying in the ab plane. The changes in magnetic behavior are well-justified by the analysis of the electronic density of states and crystal orbital Hamilton population.",

The recent advancement of halide perovskite semiconductors opens up a new path to electroluminescent devices with a greatly simplified device structure. We report cesium lead tribromide light-emitting diodes (LEDs) without the aid of an EIL or HIL. These so-called single-layer LEDs have exhibited a sub-band gap turn-on voltage. The devices obtained a brightness of 591 197 cd m(-2) at 4.8 V, with an external quantum efficiency of 5.7% and a power efficiency of 14.1 lm W-1. Such an advancement demonstrates that very high efficiency of electron and hole injection can be obtained in perovskite LEDs even without using an EIL or HIL.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Lignin can be an important source of synthetic commodity materials owing to its abundance in nature and low production cost. The current use of lignin as a raw material, however, is very limited and focused only on cheap and poorly defined nonfunctional materials. Herein we report a new lignin-containing functional polymer, lignin-graft-poly(5-acetylaminopentyl acrylate) (lignin-graft-PAA), which has been prepared by the covalent linkage of chemically modified lignin with PAA, which is an end-group functionalized polymer. This work makes two significant advances in the study of lignin containing polymers: (1) lignin-graft-PAA is the first example of lignin being modified by a polymer with sophisticated structure, and (2) lignin-graft-PAA shows a special performance, autonomic self-healing properties, which have not yet been seen in lignin containing polymers. The key synthetic step in this process utilizes a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition or \"click\" reaction in order to join together the lignin and polymer moieties. The polymer, PAA, was itself prepared via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of monomers containing multiple hydrogen-bonding sites on their pendants in the form of acetylamino functional groups. The selected RAFT agents also resulted in a polymer with an azide group at its terminus, which is necessary for the desired click reaction. Separately, biomass lignin was chemically modified by 5-hexynoic acid to introduce an alkyne functionality onto lignin. The azide terminus of the polymer was joined to the alkyne group of lignin to form a covalent bond. The lignin-graft-PAA possesses a well-dispersed multiphase nanostructure, a rigid lignin phase and a soft-PAA phase, which has a rubber-like flexibility. The mechanical properties of the newly synthesized lignin-graft-PAA can be readily controlled by the mass ratio of lignin and polymer during synthesis. In this study, the mass ratio was varied by either polymer length or weight percentage of lignin. It was revealed that a lignin-graft-PAA composite with 15-20 wt % lignin demonstrated the most optimal rubber-like, flexible property. Thanks to the high degree of hydrogen bonding from the acetylamino functionalities, lignin-graft-PAA also showed self-healing properties, recovering up to 93% of its original maximum stress before fracture.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Crystals of the first sodalite-type zeolite containing an all-iron framework, a ferrolite, Ba-8(Fe12O24)Na-y(OH)(6)center dot xH(2)O, were synthesized using the hydroflux method in nearly quantitative yield. Ba-8(Fe12O24)Na-y(OH)(6)center dot xH(2)O crystallizes in the cubic space group Pm (3) over barm with a = 10.0476-(1) angstrom. Slightly distorted FeO4 tetrahedra are linked to form Fe4O4 and Fe6O6 rings, which in turn yield channels and internal cavities that are characteristic of the sodalite structure. Barium, sodium, and hydroxide ions and water molecules are found in the channels and provide charge balance. Magnetic measurements indicate that the ferrolite exhibits magnetic order up to at least 700 K, with the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled curves diverging. Analysis of the Fe-57 Mossbauer spectra revealed two spectral components that have equal spectral areas, indicating the presence of two subsets of iron centers in the structure. Dehydrated versions of the ferrolite were also prepared by heating the sample.",

Both covalently bonded intermediates and weak intermolecular complexes are identified and characterized. We found that reactions that involve covalent intermediates have substantially higher activation barriers and are not likely to play a role in hydrogen transfer kinetics. The van der Waals complexation with carbon dioxide does not affect hydrogen transfer from formaldehyde, but it lowers the barrier for hydroperoxyl self-reaction by nearly 3 kcal/mol. This indicates that CO2 environment is likely to have catalytic effect on HO2 self-reaction, which needs to be included in kinetic combustion mechanisms in supercritical CO2.",

      "Abstract Note" : "NMDA receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels. In the continuous presence of saturating agonists, NMDA receptors undergo stationary gating, in which the channel stochastically switches between an open state that permits ion conductance and a closed state that prevents permeation. The ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the four subunits are expected to have closed clefts in the channel-open state. On the other hand, there is little knowledge about the conformational status of the LBDs in the channel-closed state during stationary gating. To probe the latter conformational status, Kussius and Popescu engineered interlobe disulfide cross-links in NMDA receptors and found that the cross-linking produced stationary gating kinetics that differed only subtly from that produced by agonist binding. These authors assumed that the cross-linking immobilized the LBDs in cleft-closed conformations, and consequently concluded that throughout stationary gating, agonist-bound LBDs also stayed predominantly in cleft-closed conformations and made only infrequent excursions to cleft-open conformations. Here, by calculating the conformational free energies of cross-linked and agonist-bound LBDs, we assess whether cross-linking actually traps the LBDs in cleft-closed conformations and delineate semiclosed conformations of agonist-bound LBDs that may potentially be thermodynamically and kinetically important during stationary gating. Our free-energy results show that the cross-linked LBDs are not locked in the fully closed form; rather, they sample semiclosed conformations almost as readily as the agonist-bound LBDs. Several lines of reasoning suggest that LBDs are semiclosed in the channel-closed state during stationary gating. Our free-energy simulations suggest possible structural details of such semiclosed LBD conformations, including intra- and intermolecular interactions that serve as alternatives to those in the cleft-closed conformations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study reports the static and dynamic magnetic characterization of two mononuclear tetrahedral Co-II complexes, [Co{(Pr2P)-Pr-i(E)NP(E)Pr-i(2)}(2)], where E = S (<bold>CoS4<\/bold>) and Se (<bold>CoSe4<\/bold>), which behave as single-ion magnets (SIMs). Low-temperature (15 K) single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies point out that the two complexes exhibit similar structural features in their first coordination sphere, but a disordered peripheral Pr-ii group is observed only in <bold>CoS4<\/bold>. Although the latter complex crystallizes in an axial space group, the observed structural disorder leads to larger transverse magnetic anisotropy for the majority of the molecules compared to <bold>CoSe4<\/bold>, as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Static magnetic characterization indicates that both <bold>CoS4<\/bold> and <bold>CoSe4<\/bold> show easy-axis anisotropy, with comparable D values (similar to-30 cm(1)). Moreover, alternating-current susceptibility measurements on these Co-II complexes, magnetically diluted in their isostructural Zn-II analogues, highlight the role of dipolar magnetic coupling in the mechanism of magnetization reversal. In addition, our findings suggest that, despite their similar anisotropic features, <bold>CoS4<\/bold> and <bold>CoSe4<\/bold> relax magnetically via different processes. This work provides experimental evidence that solid-state effects may affect the magnetic behavior of SIMs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Rising mean temperatures, sea-level rise, and the increasing frequencies of extreme climate events, such as drought and heat waves, are expected to destabilize global food systems. In response to this challenge, there has been a growing body of research seeking to address climate change impacts on food systems. To evaluate the current directions of climate change and food systems research, we undertook a literature search of 196 peer-reviewed articles on the topic of climate change and food systems. Studies varied in scope and methodology, and many were framed in the context of food security. Three recurring themes within climate change and food systems research were identified: (1) vulnerability and adaptation, (2) sustainable food systems, and/or (3) biophysical impacts on food production. Additionally, we identified research gaps and discernible directions for future research. Our synthesis suggests that much of the current climate change and food systems research neglects systems-based perspectives to conceptualizing problems and solutions, there is little consideration of the differential impacts of biophysical drivers and associated outcomes in different regions, and finally, there is a lack of critical perspectives addressing underlying political structures that maintain current food systems. We suggest that future research bridge these gaps if we are to adequately address the inherently complex nature of food systems under a changing climate.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Drawing from social/political influence, leader-member exchange (LMX), and social comparison theories, the present two-study investigation examines three levels of LMX differentiation (i.e., individual-level, meso-level, and group-level LMX differentiation) and further tests a model of the joint effects of political skill and LMX differentiation on LMX, relative LMX, and employee work outcomes. In Study 1, we used data from 231 employees and found support for the interactive effect of political skill and individual perceptions of LMX differentiation on LMX quality. We also found partial support for the moderating role of individual-level LMX differentiation on the indirect effects of political skill on self-rated task performance and job satisfaction via LMX. In Study 2, we used data from 185 supervisor-subordinate dyads and examined both meso-level and group-level LMX differentiation via a multilevel moderated mediation model. Results supported the moderating role of group-level LMX differentiation and group mean LMX on the indirect effects of political skill on supervisor-rated task performance and contextual performance/citizenship behavior as well as job satisfaction via relative LMX. Overall, the results suggest that politically skilled employees reap the benefits of LMX differentiation, as they enjoy higher absolute LMX and relative (i.e., to their peers) LMX quality.

      "Abstract Note" : "Local government sustainability has become a cause celebre in urban policy. Extant research has attempted to construct narratives of sustainable environmental, economic, and social equity motivations by grouping together multifaceted types of policies adopted to deal with multidimensional problems of land use, transportation, energy, solid waste, carbon emissions, and other functional areas of local government. Yet, decades of policy adoption and implementation research suggest some policies or policy tools require a far greater commitment of resources and administrative and political buy-in than others. We explore whether the degree of such commitment reflects different motivations at play and test for distinct political economies for specific categories of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction policy tools. We find evidence that the determinants for the two types of policies are distinct, and subsequent research requires refocusing theoretical and empirical efforts at differentiating \"win-win\" tools from more \"altruistic\" commitments to sustainable action by governments.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Comprehension monitoring has received substantial attention as a reading comprehension strategy. However, comprehension monitoring is not limited to the reading context, but applies to the oral context for children's listening comprehension, which is a critical foundation for reading comprehension. Therefore, a systematic and explicit instructional routine for comprehension monitoring in oral language contexts was developed for prekindergartners from low-income families. Instruction was provided in small groups for approximately 5 min a day for 4 days a week for 8 weeks. Results showed that children who received comprehension monitoring instruction were better at identifying inconsistencies in short stories than those who received typical instruction with a medium effect size (d = .57). These results suggest comprehension monitoring is malleable and can be taught in the oral language context to prereaders from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Furthermore, the instructional routine reported in this study is flexible for individual, small group, or whole class settings, and likely can be easily delivered by educators such as teachers and paraeducators.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Solution-processed hybrid organic inorganic lead halide perovskites are emerging as one of the most promising candidates for low-cost light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, due to a small exciton binding energy, it is not yet possible to achieve an efficient electroluminescence within the blue wavelength region at room temperature, as is necessary for full-spectrum light sources. Here, we demonstrate efficient blue LEDs based on the colloidal, quantum confined 2D perovskites, with precisely controlled stacking down to one-unit-cell thickness (n = 1). A variety of low-k organic host compounds are used to disperse the 2D perovskites, effectively creating a matrix of the dielectric quantum wells, which significantly boosts the exciton binding energy by the dielectric confinement effect. Through the Forster resonance energy transfer, the excitons down-convert and recombine radiatively in the 2D perovskites. We report room-temperature pure green (n = 7-10), sky blue (n = 5), pure blue (n = 3), and deep blue (n = 1) electroluminescence, with record-high external quantum efficiencies in the green-to-blue wavelength region.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite myriad attempts by supply chain managers and exhortation by scholars, many firms remain insufficiently integrated across internal functional areas. Supply chain management research has hinted that the difficulty may be due to social dynamics occurring within and between organizational departments (i.e., organizational politics) and the perceptions thereof held by employees. This study examines whether perceptions of organizational politics held by firm employees negatively impact internal integration directly, or indirectly via inhibiting the firm's supply chain orientation. Based on social exchange theory and social influence theory, the research also assesses whether the potentially harmful impacts of political perceptions on internal integration are/can be mitigated by employees' perception of the political skill of the top supply chain management executivea person charged with ensuring the firm's supply chain will function successfully. The findings of a broad managerial survey conducted within the U.S. retail industry suggest that perceptions of organizational politics within organizations do directly influence internal integration. Furthermore, the relationship between organizational politics and supply chain orientation is impacted when the top supply chain executive is perceived to be politically skilled.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BackgroundScholars have documented the significant physical health consequences of intimate partner violence. Yet, because existing research draws primarily on clinical samples of adult women, it is unclear whether exposure to dating violence is related to health detriments among young men and women. Furthermore, data limitations largely have precluded consideration of the mechanisms underlying these previously observed associations. AimsWe sought to examine the direct association between dating violence and self-rated physical health during adolescence and across the transition to adulthood. We also directed attention to potential mediating and confounding factors, including negative relationship dynamics, anti-social lifestyle characteristics and physical health correlates. MethodsDrawing on five waves of data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (n=3746 person-periods), we used growth curve analyses to examine these associations among a sample of young men and women in dating relationships. ResultsLongitudinal analyses revealed that dating violence was associated with declines in self-rated physical health across the period from adolescence to young adulthood. This effect, however, was attenuated with the inclusion of negative relationship dynamics. ConclusionsFindings suggest the need to further examine the physical health consequences of dating violence, with a particular focus on the relationship context and other potential confounding forces.

      "Abstract Note" : "Human thrombopoietin (hTPO) primarily stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production and is neutralized by the mouse TN1 antibody. The thermodynamic characteristics of TN1 antibody-hTPO complexation were analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) derived from the TN1 antibody (TN1-Fab). To clarify the mechanism by which hTPO is recognized by TN1-Fab the conformation of free TN1-Fab was determined to a resolution of 2.0 angstrom using X-ray crystallography and compared with the hTPO-bound form of TN1-Fab determined by a previous study. This structural comparison revealed that the conformation of TN1-Fab does not substantially change after hTPO binding and a set of 15 water molecules is released from the antigen-binding site (paratope) of TN1-Fab upon hTPO complexation. Interestingly, the heat capacity change (Cp) measured by ITC (-1.52 +/- 0.05 kJmol(-1)K(-1)) differed significantly from calculations based upon the X-ray structure data of the hTPO-bound and unbound forms of TN1-Fab (-1.02 approximate to 0.25 kJmol(-1)K(-1)) suggesting that hTPO undergoes an induced-fit conformational change combined with significant desolvation upon TN1-Fab binding. The results shed light on the structural biology associated with neutralizing antibody recognition.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Temperature is known to influence ecosystem processes through its direct effect on biological rates such as respiration and nutrient cycling. These changes can then indirectly affect ecologically processes by altering trophic dynamics, the persistence of a species in a given environment, and, consequently, its distribution. However, it is not known if this direct effect of temperature on biological rates is singularly the most important factor for the functioning of ecosystems, or if trophic structure and the adaptation of a species to the local environment also play an essential role. Understanding the relative importance of these factors is crucial for predicting the impact that climate change will have on species and ecosystems. To achieve a more complete understanding of the impact of changing temperatures, it is necessary to integrate perspectives from biogeography, such as the influences of species distribution and local adaptation, with ecosystem and community ecology. By using the microbial community inhabiting the water-filled leaves of Sarracenia purpurea, we tested the importance of temperature, trophic structure, and local adaptation on ecosystem functioning. We accomplished this by collecting communities along a natural temperature gradient and maintaining these communities in a common garden, factorial experiment. To test for the importance of local adaptation and temperature, the origin of each community was crossed with the temperature from each site. Additionally, to test the importance of top-down trophic regulation for ecosystem functioning, the presence of the mosquito larvae top predator was manipulated. We found that temperature has a greater effect on ecosystem functioning than origin, and that top-down trophic regulation increased with temperature. Our results emphasize the synergistic effects of temperature and biotic interactions when predicting the consequences of global warming on ecosystem functioning.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Many exotic metallic systems have a resistivity that varies linearly with temperature, and the physics behind this is thought to be connected to high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates and iron pnictides(1-9). Although this phenomenon has attracted considerable attention, it is unclear how the relevant physics manifests in other transport properties, for example their response to an applied magnetic field. We report measurements of the high-field magnetoresistance of the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe2(As1-xPx)(2) and find that it obeys an unusual scaling relationship between applied magnetic field and temperature, with a conversion factor given simply by the ratio of the Bohr magneton and the Boltzmann constant. This suggests that magnetic fields probe the same physics that gives rise to the T-linear resistivity, providing a new experimental clue to this long-standing puzzle.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Four novel alkaline earth metal uranyl borates, namely, A[(UO2)(5)(BO3)(2)O-2(OH)(2)]center dot 5H(2)O (SrUBO-1, BaUBO-1) and A[(UO2)(2)(B2O5)O] (SrUBO-2, BaUBO-2) (A = Sr, Ba), have been prepared; SrUBO-1, BaUBO-1, and BaUBO-2 were synthesized using hydrothermal methods, whereas SrUBO-2 was prepared by a traditional high-temperature solid-state method. The compounds SrUBO-1 and BaUBO-1 were found to be iso-structural and crystallized in the centrosymmetric group C2/c. Their structure features two-dimensional anionic layers {[(UO2)(5)(BO3)(2)O-2(OH)(2)](2-)}(n) that are composed of [(UO2)(5)O-2(OH)(2)](4+) clusters and [BO3](3-) polyanions. From a topological point of view, this two- dimensional anionic layer can be described as a new 4-nodal net topological type with a point symbol of {3(5).4(5)}(2){3(6).4(6).5(3)}(3){3(7).4(7).5(7)}(2). SrUBO-2 and BaUBO-2 are iso-structural and crystallized in space group C2/m. Their structures are based on a three-dimensional framework {[(UO2)(2)(B2O5)O](2-)}(n). Within the three-dimensional framework, two-dimensional U(2)-U(1) = U(3) layers (L-1) with cation to cation interactions between [U(3)O-2](2+) groups and one-dimensional edge sharing U(1)-U(2) chains are present. The B2O5 dimers corner sharing with U(1)-U2 chains and U(3)O-6 tetragonal bipyramids forming two-dimensional layers (L-2). L-1 further vertically interconnect with L-2 through bridging B2O5 dimers, forming a three-dimensional framework [(UO2)(2)(B2O5)O](2-). The synthetic conditions, structural characterization, thermal stability, as well as spectroscopic properties of the alkaline earth metal uranyl borates are reported and discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In response to the current global health emergency posed by the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak and its link to microcephaly and other neurological conditions, we performed a drug repurposing screen of similar to 6,000 compounds that included approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and pharmacologically active compounds; we identified compounds that either inhibit ZIKV infection or suppress infection-induced caspase-3 activity in different neural cells. A pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3 activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally unrelated inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy and identify lead compounds for anti-ZIKV drug development.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background and ObjectivesSmoking rates are markedly higher among trauma-exposed individuals relative to non-trauma-exposed individuals. Extant work suggests that both perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies are independent mechanisms that link trauma-related symptoms and smoking. Yet, no work has examined perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies as potential explanatory variables for the relation between trauma-related symptom severity and smoking in a sequential pathway model. Methods The present study utilized a sample of treatment-seeking, trauma-exposed smokers (n=363; 49.0% female) to examine perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies for smoking as potential sequential explanatory variables linking trauma-related symptom severity and nicotine dependence, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and severity of withdrawal-related problems and symptoms during past quit attempts. ResultsAs hypothesized, perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies had a significant sequential indirect effect on trauma-related symptom severity and criterion variables. Conclusions and Scientific SignificanceFindings further elucidate the complex pathways through which trauma-related symptoms contribute to smoking behavior and cognitions, and highlight the importance of addressing perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies in smoking cessation programs among trauma-exposed individuals.

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper investigates regularization for continuously observed covariates that resemble step functions. The motivating examples come from operational test data from a recent US Department of Defense test of the Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft system. The response variable, quality of video provided by the Shadow to friendly ground units, was measured on an ordinal scale continuously over time. Functional covariates, altitude and distance, can be well approximated by step functions. Two approaches for regularizing these covariates are considered, including a thinning approach commonly used within the Department of Defense to address autocorrelated time series data, and a novel ` smoothing' approach, which first approximates the covariates as step functions and then treats each ` step' as a uniquely observed data point. Datasets resulting from both approaches are fit using a mixed model cumulative logistic regression, and we compare their results. While the thinning approach identifies altitude as having a significant impact on video quality, the smoothing approach finds no evidence of an effect. This difference is attributable to the larger effective sample size produced by thinning. System characteristics make it unlikely that video quality would degrade at higher altitudes, suggesting that the thinning approach has produced a Type 1 error. By accounting for the functional characteristics of the covariates, the novel smoothing approach has produced a more accurate characterization of the Shadow's ability to provide full motion video to supported units.

      "Abstract Note" : "We report pH-switching properties of the new family of dipeptide acetylene conjugates where pH-gated light-activated double-strand (ds) DNA cleavage is controlled by variations in electronic and geometric parameters. The conjugates have higher activities at the slightly acidic pH values that separate normal and cancerous tissue (pH < 7). This favorable pH dependence originates from several elements of structural design. Basicities of the two amines determine the threshold pH range where the changes in binding and reactivity are observed, whereas the distance between the two amino groups and the hydrophobic aryl alkyne moiety can further modulate DNA binding. The changes of the protonation state from a neutral molecule to a dication results in dramatically increased efficiency of ds DNA photocleavage, the most therapeutically valuable type of DNA cleavage.",

In this study, we achieved complete SeO42- bioreduction in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) using CH4 as the sole added electron donor. The introduction of nitrate (NO3-) slightly inhibited SeO42- reduction, but the two oxyanions were simultaneously reduced, even when the supply rate of CH4 was limited. The main SeO42- reduction product was nanospherical Se, which was identified by scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS). Community analysis provided evidence for two mechanisms for SeO42- bioreduction in the CH4-based MBfR: a single methanotrophic genus, such as Methylomonas, performed CH4 oxidation directly coupled to SeO42- reduction, and a methanotroph oxidized CH4 to form organic metabolites that were electron donors for a synergistic SeO42--reducing bacterium.",

At room temperature varying reaction conditions, cobalt-ligand ratios and use of different bases allowed unique types of coordination self-assembly. The synthetic marvel lies in the nature of aggregation with respect to the two unrelated cores in 1 and 2. Complex 1 assumes a V-shaped arrangement bound to L-, water and a trifluoroacetate anion, while 2 grows around a central Co-II ion surrounded by a {Co-6(II)} hexagon bound to methoxide and L-. Magnetic measurements revealed that the intermetallic interactions are antiferromagnetic in nature in the case of complex 1 and ferromagnetic in the case of 2 involving high spin cobalt(II) ions with stabilization of the high-spin ground state in the latter case. In MeCN solutions complexes 1 and 2 showed catalytic oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBCH2) to 3,5-di-tert-butylbenzoquinone (3,5-DTBQ) in air. The kinetic study in MeCN revealed that with respect to the catalytic turnover number (k(cat)) 2 is more effective than 1 for oxidation of 3,5-DTBCH2.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This work discloses the first general solution for converting oligoalkynes into polyaromatic polycyclic systems free of pentagonal defects. The efficiency and selectivity of this cascade originate from the combination of the Bu3Sn-mediated TDG (traceless directing group) cascade transformations of skipped alkynes where the reactivity of the key radical precursor is tempered by hybridization effects. This approach ensures that the final structure consists of only six-membered rings. Practical implementation of this strategy is readily accomplished by incorporation of a suitably-substituted alkene as a final unit in the domino transformation. This strategy opens a new avenue for the controlled preparation of polyaromatic ribbons. The resulting ester functionality can be used for an additional Friedel-Crafts ring closure which effectively anneals two extra cycles with distinct electronic features to the extended aromatic system formed by the radical cascade.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Biomorphs are complex, life-like structures that emerge from the precipitation of barium carbonate and amorphous silica in alkaline media. Despite their inorganic nature, these microstructures have non-crystallographic morphologies such as helices and cardioid sheets. At the nanoscale, biomorphs arrange thousands of crystalline nanorods as hierarchical assemblies that resemble natural biominerals suggesting novel approaches towards the production of biomimetic materials. We report the synthesis of silica-carbonate biomorphs in single-phase, gradient-free solutions that differ markedly from the typical solution-gas or gel-solution setups. Our experimental approach significantly increases the duration of biomorph growth and hence assembles networks in which individual helices extend to several millimeters. These unusually long biomorphs allow the first quantitative measurements of mesoscopic parameters such as the helix wavelength, period, width, and linear as well as tangential growth velocities. We find that the latter quantities are system-specific and tightly conserved during many hours of growth. Moreover, the average double helix wavelength of (19 +/- 3) mm and width of (9.6 +/- 0.8) mm vary by less than 12% when the initial carbonate concentration is changed by three orders of magnitude. We also delineate the single helix growth mechanism and report the occurrence of ribbon-like structures and highly regular \"superhelices\". Our experiments clearly demonstrate the robustness and consistency of biomorph growth under stable chemical conditions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Gulf of Mexico saltmarsh sediments were heavily impacted by Macondo well oil (MWO) released from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Detailed molecular-level characterization of sediment extracts collected over 48 months post-spill highlights the chemical complexity of highly polar, oxygen-containing compounds that remain environmentally persistent. Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), combined with chromatographic prefractionation, correlates bulk chemical properties to elemental compositions of oil-transformation products as a function of time. Carboxylic acid incorporation into parent MWO hydrocarbons detected in sediment extracts (corrected for mass loss relative to C-30 hopane) proceeds with an increase of similar to 3-fold in O-2 species after 9 months to a maximum of a similar to 5.5-fold increase after 36 months, compared to the parent MWO. More importantly, higher-order oxygenated compounds (O-4-O-6) not detected in the parent MWO increase in relative abundance with time as lower-order oxygenated species are transformed into highly polar, oxygen-containing compounds (O-x, where x > 3). Here, we present the first molecular-level characterization of temporal compositional changes that occur in Deepwater Horizon derived oil contamination deposited in a saltmarsh ecosystem from 9 to 48 months post-spill and identify highly oxidized Macondo well oil compounds that are not detectable by routine gas-chromatography-based techniques.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Mercury (Hg) wet deposition, transfer from the atmosphere to Earth's surface by precipitation, in the United States is highest in locations and seasons with frequent deep convective thunderstorms, but it has never been demonstrated whether the connection is causal or simple coincidence. We use rainwater samples from over 800 individual precipitation events to show that thunderstorms increase Hg concentrations by 50% relative to weak convective or stratiform events of equal precipitation depth. Radar and satellite observations reveal that strong convection reaching the upper troposphere (where high atmospheric concentrations of soluble, oxidized mercury species (Hg(II)) are known to reside) produces the highest Hg concentrations in rain. As a result, precipitation meteorology, especially thunderstorm frequency and total rainfall, explains differences in Hg deposition between study sites located in the eastern United States. Assessing the fate of atmospheric mercury thus requires bridging the scales of global transport and convective precipitation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Estimates of methane emissions from landfills rely primarily on models due to both technical and economic limitations. While models are easy to implement, there is uncertainty due to the use of parameters that are difficult to validate. The objective of this research was to compare modeled emissions using several greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting protocols including: (1) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); (2) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (EPA GHGRP); (3) California Air Resources Board (CARB); and (4) Solid Waste Industry for Climate Solutions (SWICS), with measured emissions data collected over three calendar years from a young landfill with no gas collection system. By working with whole landfill measurements of fugitive methane emissions and methane oxidation, the collection efficiency could be set to zero, thus eliminating one source of parameter uncertainty. The models consistently overestimated annual methane emissions by a factor ranging from 4-31. Varying input parameters over reasonable ranges reduced this range to 1.3-8. Waste age at the studied landfill was less than four years and the results suggest the need for measurements at additional landfills to evaluate the accuracy of the tested models to young landfills.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A unique two-dimensional inorganic cationic network with the formula [Th3O2(IO3)(5)(OH)(2)]Cl was synthesized hydrothermally. Its crystal structure can best be described as positively charged slabs built with hexanuclear thorium clusters connected by iodate trigonal pyramids. Additional chloride anions are present in the interlayer spaces but surprisingly are not exchangeable, as demonstrated by a series of CrO42- uptake experiments. This is because all chloride anions are trapped by multiple strong halogen halogen interactions with short Cl I bond lengths ranging from 3.134 to 3.333 angstrom, forming a special Cl-centered trigonal-pyramidal polyhedron as a newly observed coordination mode for halogen bonds. Density functional theory calculations clarified that electrons transformed from central Cl atoms to I atoms, generating a halogen halogen interaction energy with a value of about -8.3 kcal mol(-1) per Cl center dot center dot center dot I pair as well as providing a total value of -57.9 kcal mol(-1) among delocalized halogen-halogen bonds, which is a new record value reported for a single halogen atom. Additional hydrogen-bonding interaction is also present between Cl and OH, and the interaction energy is predicted to be -8.1 kcal mol(-1), confirming the strong total interaction to lock the interlayer Cl anions.",

This paper proposes a novel class of cure-rate model, the transform-both-sides cure-rate model (TBSCRM), that can be used to make inferences about both the cure-rate and the survival quantiles. We develop the Bayesian inference about the covariate effects on the cure-rate as well as on the survival quantiles via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tools. We also show that the TBSCRM-based Bayesian method outperforms existing cure-rate models based methods in our simulation studies and in application to the breast cancer survival data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Cultural group identity and group norms are significantly related to social exclusion evaluations (Bennett, ). This study examined 241 Jewish-American mid (M=14.18years, SD=0.42) to late (M=17.21years, SD=0.43; M-ageTOTAL=15.54years, SD=1.57) adolescents' cultural identities and contextually salient perceived group norms in relation to their evaluations of Arab-American inclusion and exclusion across two contexts (peers vs. family at home). Results suggest that perceived group norms are related to the context in which they are applied: parents in the home and peers in the peer context. Peers remained a significant source of perceived group norms in the home context. Significant interactions emerged between perceived parent group norms and cultural identity. Findings highlight the need to address group-specific norms by context to ensure maximum effectiveness for intergroup interventions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hypothalamic orexin neurons project to numerous brain areas, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is involved in motivation and food-seeking behavior. Here we address how exogenously administered orexin-A and endogenous orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) activation in the VTA affects feeding behavior. We hypothesized that orexin-A and OX1R antagonist SB334867 delivered to the VTA, at doses that were subthreshold for effect when injected into the ventricle, would affect intake of palatable foods in multiple test situations. We first used a hedonic feeding model in which satiated rats selectively consume a high-fat diet (HFD). Intra-VTA orexin-A stimulated additional consumption of chow and increased HFD intake in this model. In ad libitum-fed rats given daily 30-min test sessions, intra-VTA orexin-A also increased intake of HFD and 0.1 M sucrose. Further analysis of licking patterns revealed that that VTA orexin-A increased meal size and licking burst size only toward the end of the meal. Consistent with this finding, a subthreshold dose of VTA orexin-A prevented intake suppression induced by gastrointestinal nutrient infusion. Surprisingly, intra-VTA orexin-A had no effect on operant responding for sucrose pellets on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. A role for endogenous VTA OX1R stimulation is supported by our finding that bilateral VTA injection of the selective OX1R antagonist SB334867 suppressed 0.1 M sucrose intake. Together, our data suggest that OX1R activity in the VTA facilitates food intake, potentially by counteracting postingestive negative feedback that would normally suppress feeding later in a meal.",

      "Abstract Note" : "There are a dearth of studies that quantitatively measure nurses' appreciation of stimuli and the subsequent generation of options in practice environments. The purpose of this paper was to provide an examination of nurses' ability to solve problems while quantifying the stimuli upon which they focus during patient care activities. The study used a quantitative descriptive method that gathered performance data from a simulated task environment using multi-angle video and audio. These videos were coded and transcripts of all of the actions that occurred in the scenario and the verbal reports of the participants were compiled. The results revealed a pattern of superiority of the experienced exemplar group. Novice actions were characterized by difficulty in following common protocols, inconsistencies in their evaluative approaches, and a pattern of omissions of key actions. The study provides support for the deliberate practice-based programs designed to facilitate higher-level performance in novices.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend statins for adults age <= 75 years who have clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (IA) and adults age 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C 70-189mg/dl (IA). Our aim was to estimate the prevalence and likelihood of statin use among selected statin benefit groups. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012, we examined 5319 adults age >= 20 years. We estimated weighted frequencies and prevalence of statin use for adults with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia (or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >= 70 mg/dL), defined as statin benefit group 1 (SBG1); and for adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as statin benefit group 2 (SBG2). We constructed a logistic regression model to estimate odds of statin use in SBG1. Overall, an estimated 38.6 million Americans are on a statin. In adjusted models, uninsured and Hispanic adults were less likely to be on a statin compared with white adults; 59.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.0-66.1) of all adults in SBG1, 58.8% (95% CI: 51.5-66.1) of adults age 40 to 75 in SBG1, and 63.5% (95% CI: 55.6-71.4) of all adults in SBG2 were on a statin. Although the prevalence of statin use has increased over time, Hispanic ethnicity and lack of insurance remain barriers to statin use. Black-white racial disparities were not significant. Our study provides a baseline estimate of statin use in the noninstitutionalized population just prior to introduction of the new guidelines and provides a reference for evaluating the impact of the new guidelines on statin utilization.",

      "Abstract Note" : "ObjectivesSome researchers suggest that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by elevated negative emotion; others argue that BPD involves both reduced positive and increased negative emotion. This study characterizes the emotional experiences of individuals with BPD symptoms in a combined university and community sample. MethodParticipants (N = 150) completed a clinical interview assessing BPD symptoms and self-report measures of positive and negative emotion. A subset (n = 106) completed a measure of emotion daily for 2 weeks. Pearson's correlations and multilevel modeling were used to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between BPD symptoms and emotions. ResultsBPD symptoms were robustly related to increased negative emotion; this relationship remained after accounting for positive emotion. BPD symptoms were weakly related to decreased positive emotion; this relationship was no longer significant after accounting for negative emotion. BPD symptoms predicted higher levels of negative and not positive emotion over 14 days. These patterns held for subscales assessing intensity, frequency, and duration of negative and positive emotions. ConclusionFindings suggest that individuals with BPD features are chiefly distinguished by elevated negative emotional experience.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We detail the design of hydrophilic metal-coordinating ligands and their use for the effective coating of luminescent quantum dots (QDs). The ligand design exploits the specific, reagent-free nudeophilic addition reaction of amine-modified molecules toward maleic anhydride to introduce several lipoic acid metal anchors, hydrophilic zwitterion moieties, and specific reactive groups along a poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PIMA) chain. Tunable reactive groups tested in this study include azide, biotin, carboxyl, and amine. Cap exchange with these multilipoic acid ligands via a photochemical ligation strategy yields homogeneous QD dispersions that are colloidally stable over several biologically relevant conditions and for extended periods of time. The zwitterionic coating yields compact nanoparticle size and imparts nonsticky surface properties onto the QDs, preventing protein absorption. The introduction of a controllable number of reactive groups allows conjugation of the QDs to biomolecules via bio-orthogonal coupling chemistries including (1) attachment of the neurotransmitter dopamine to QDs via amine-isothiocyanate reaction to produce a platform capable of probing interactions with cysteine in proteins, based on charge transfer interactions; (2) self-assembly of biotinylated QDs with streptavidin-dye; and (3) ligation of azide-functionalized QDs to cydooctyne-modified transferrin via copper-free click chemistry, used for intracellular delivery. This ligand design strategy can be used to prepare an array of metal-coordinating ligands adapted for coating other inorganic nanoparticles, including magnetic and plasmonic nanomaterials.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Estimates of post-release mortality (PRM) rates for discarded bycatch are largely unknown across marine fisheries and represent a substantial source of uncertainty when estimating total fishery mortality. One way to predict PRM is through the use of reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP), whereby the presence or absence of target reflexes and known post-release fate are used to create a delayed mortality model. We employed reflex impairment assessments in concert with post-capture caging and video monitoring to predict 5-d PRM rates for the deep-sea giant isopod Bathynomus giganteus, a common bycatch species in numerous deepwater fisheries worldwide, and also considered the factors contributing to mortality. Mortality rates 5 d post-capture ranged from 50 to 100% and both RAMP scores and time at the surface were significant predictors of mortality, although our conclusions regarding the effect of surface time are limited. In-cage video documented little movement within the 24-h monitoring period following capture, and it appeared that surviving individuals often fed within the holding period after cage deployment. Our results suggest that PRM in B. giganteus is common and that this unaccounted source of mortality should be quantified for other deep-sea crustaceans captured as bycatch.",

      "Abstract Note" : "OBJECTIVE: Despite increases in education and awareness, many athletes continue to play with signs and symptoms of a sport-related concussion (SRC). The impact that continuing to play has on recovery is unknown. This study compared recovery time and related outcomes between athletes who were immediately removed from play and athletes who continued to play with an SRC. METHODS: A prospective, repeated measures design was used to compare neurocognitive performance, symptoms, and recovery time between 35 athletes (mean +/- SD age, 15.61 +/- 1.65 years) immediately removed after an SRC (REMOVED group) compared with 34 athletes (mean +/- SD age, 15.35 +/- 1.73 years) who continued to play (PLAYED group) with SRC. Neurocognitive and symptom data were obtained at baseline and at 1 to 7 days and 8 to 30 days after an SRC. RESULTS: The PLAYED group took longer to recover than the REMOVED group (44.4 +/- 36.0 vs 22.0 +/- 18.7 days; P = .003) and were 8.80 times more likely to demonstrate protracted recovery (= 21 days) (P < .001). Removal from play status was associated with the greatest risk of protracted recovery (adjusted odds ratio, 14.27; P = .001) compared with other predictors (eg, sex). The PLAYED group exhibited significantly worse neurocognitive and greater symptoms than the REMOVED group. CONCLUSIONS: SRC recovery time may be reduced if athletes are removed from participation. Immediate removal from play is the first step in mitigating prolonged SRC recovery, and these data support current consensus statements and management guidelines.",

The psychological mechanisms through which materialism influences behavior, however, are not well studied. This paper describes a study of the influence of materialism on shopping intensity and amount of spending that takes into account the mediating influences of three important consumer characteristics: status consumption, brand engagement in self-concept, and market mavenism. The researchers fit a model of these relationships based on the Meta-theoretic Model of Motivation (3M) model to data from a sample of 351 adult U.S. consumers. The model fit the data well, and the results showed that indeed, status consumption, brand engagement, and market mavenism mediate at least partially the influence of materialism on shopping and spending.

      "Abstract Note" : "The ocean-atmosphere system is typically envisioned to have gone through a unidirectional oxygenation with significant oxygen increases in the earliest (ca. 635Ma), middle (ca. 580Ma), or late (ca. 560Ma) Ediacaran Period. However, temporally discontinuous geochemical data and the patchy metazoan fossil record have been inadequate to chart the details of Ediacaran ocean oxygenation, raising fundamental debates about the timing of ocean oxygenation, its purported unidirectional rise, and its causal relationship, if any, with the evolution of early animal life. To better understand the Ediacaran ocean redox evolution, we have conducted a multi-proxy paleoredox study of a relatively continuous, deep-water section in South China that was paleogeographically connected with the open ocean. Iron speciation and pyrite morphology indicate locally euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) environments throughout the Ediacaran in this section. In the same rocks, redox sensitive element enrichments and sulfur isotope data provide evidence for multiple oceanic oxygenation events (OOEs) in a predominantly anoxic global Ediacaran-early Cambrian ocean. This dynamic redox landscape contrasts with a recent view of a redox-static Ediacaran ocean without significant change in oxygen content. The duration of the Ediacaran OOEs may be comparable to those of the oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) in otherwise well-oxygenated Phanerozoic oceans. Anoxic events caused mass extinctions followed by fast recovery in biologically diversified Phanerozoic oceans. In contrast, oxygenation events in otherwise ecologically monotonous anoxic Ediacaran-early Cambrian oceans may have stimulated biotic innovations followed by prolonged evolutionary stasis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "For geological CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers, the interfacial tension (IFT) between supercritical CO2 and brine is critical for the storage security and design of the storage capacitance. However, currently, no predictive model exists to determine the IFT of supercritical CO2 against complex electrolyte solutions involving various mixed salt species at different concentrations and compositions. In this paper, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the effect of salt ions on the incremental IFT at the supercritical CO2 brineinterface with respect to that at the reference supercritical CO2 water interface. Supercritical CO2-NaCl solution, CO2-CaCl, solution and CO2-(NaCl +CaCl2) mixed solution systems are simulated at 343 K and 20 MPa under different salinities and salt compositions. We find that the valence of the cations is the primary contributor to the variation in IFT, while the Lennard-Jones potentials for the cations pose a smaller impact on the IFT. Interestingly, the incremental IFT exhibits a general linear correlation with the ionic strength in the above three electrolyte systems, and the slopes are almost identical and independent of the solution types. Based on this finding, a universal predictive formula for IFTs of CO2-complex electrolyte solution systems is established, as a function of ionic strength, temperature, and pressure. The predicted IFTs using the established formula agree perfectly (with a high statistical confidence level of 96%) with a wide range of experimental data for CO2 interfacing with different electrolyte solutions, such as those involving MgCl2 and Na2SO4. This work provides an efficient and accurate route to directly predict IFTs in supercritical CO2-complex electrolyte solution systems for practical engineering applications, such as geological CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers and other interfacial systems involving complex electrolyte solutions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The range sizes of sediment-dwelling deep-sea species are largely unknown. Such knowledge is important because a deep sea composed in large part of species with 100-km-scale ranges would be very different from one composed predominantly of species with 1000-km-scale ranges. For example, the total species richness would be much greater in the first case than in the second. As a step towards the determination of the distribution of species' range sizes in the deep sea, we asked whether harpacticoid copepods (Crustacea) on the continental rise in the northeastern Pacific had 1000-km-scale range sizes. We chose harpacticoids because they occur widely in deep-sea sediments and thus are a typical deep-sea taxon. In addition, they have no pelagic stage in their life history, so they allow a conservative test of hypotheses about species' range sizes. We used morphology and gene-sequence data to assign individuals to species. At least 13.3% of the species we studied had 1000-km-scale ranges, raising the question of how these species maintain genetic continuity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Permafrost thaw exposes previously frozen soil organic matter to microbial decomposition. This process generates methane and carbon dioxide, and thereby fuels a positive feedback process that leads to further warming and thaw(1). Despite widespread permafrost degradation during the past similar to 40 years(2-4), the degree to which permafrost thaw may be contributing to a feedback between warming and thaw in recent decades is not well understood. Radiocarbon evidence of modern emissions of ancient permafrost carbon is also sparse(5). Here we combine radiocarbon dating of lake bubble trace-gas methane (113 measurements) and soil organic carbon (289 measurements) for lakes in Alaska, Canada, Sweden and Siberia with numerical modelling of thaw and remote sensing of thermokarst shore expansion. Methane emissions from thermokarst areas of lakes that have expanded over the past 60 years were directly proportional to the mass of soil carbon inputs to the lakes from the erosion of thawing permafrost. Radiocarbon dating indicates that methane age from lakes is nearly identical to the age of permafrost soil carbon thawing around them. Based on this evidence of landscape-scale permafrost carbon feedback, we estimate that 0.2 to 2.5 Pg permafrost carbon was released as methane and carbon dioxide in thermokarst expansion zones of pan-Arctic lakes during the past 60 years.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Relationship self-efficacy (RSE) is the belief that one can resolve relationship conflicts, and it may lead victims of situational violence to remain in their relationships because they expect to minimize subsequent violence. Indeed, a longitudinal study of two samples of college students demonstrated that RSE moderates the effects of victimization on relationship dissolution; intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization was positively associated with dissolution among intimates low in RSE but was unassociated with dissolution among intimates high in RSE. Interestingly, although RSE was negatively associated with dissolution among victims, it was associated with experiencing less subsequent IPV in one sample. Ultimately, whether victims' RSE is adaptive may depend on the extent to which any minimization of conflicts eliminates violence.",

There remains a knowledge gap in understanding why organizational actors choose to allocate resources to adopt branding and marketing policies. This article explores organizational branding initiatives within the context of research extensive (N = 109) higher education institutions in the United States from 2006 to 2013. Seventy-two universities (66 percent) have introduced branding initiatives since 2006. Findings suggest that the publicness of organizations influences branding and marketing isomorphism in nuanced ways and that organizations are more likely to adopt new branding initiatives to promote higher general performance. Organizations adopt branding strategies in response to national trends and efforts to capitalize on their own strong performance rather than mimicking stronger-performing peers.",

High skewness issuers incur significantly greater offer price discounts, particularly when institutional share allocation is largest, pay higher gross underwriting spreads, and exhibit poorer stock performance in the three years after issuance, all compared to low skewness issuers. These results suggest that skewness-induced overpricing increases the flotation costs of seasoned equity offers and leads to poor subsequent stock performance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Land-use change and climate change are driving a global biodiversity crisis. Yet, how species' responses to climate change are correlated with their responses to land-use change is poorly understood. Here, we assess the linkages between climate and land-use change on birds in Neotropical forest and agriculture. Across > 300 species, we show that affiliation with drier climates is associated with an ability to persist in and colonise agriculture. Further, species shift their habitat use along a precipitation gradient: species prefer forest in drier regions, but use agriculture more in wetter zones. Finally, forest-dependent species that avoid agriculture are most likely to experience decreases in habitable range size if current drying trends in the Neotropics continue as predicted. This linkage suggests a synergy between the primary drivers of biodiversity loss. Because they favour the same species, climate and land-use change will likely homogenise biodiversity more severely than otherwise anticipated.",

In this study, for the first time, we attempt to alleviate this lacuna of knowledge by comprehensively investigating the Y chromosome composition of contemporary Mayan populations throughout their domain. To accomplish this, five geographically targeted and ethnically distinct Mayan populations are investigated using Y-SNP and Y-STR markers. Findings: overall, the Mayan populations as a group are highly homogeneous, basically made up of only two autochthonous haplogroups, Q1a2a1a1*-M3 and Q1a2a1*-L54. Although the Y-STR data illustrates diversity, this diversity, for the most part, is uniformly distributed among geographically distant Mayan populations. Similar haplotypes among populations, abundance of singletons and absence of population partitioning within networks among Mayan populations suggest recent population expansion and substantial gene flow within the Mayan dominion, possibly due to the development of agriculture, the establishment of interacting City-State systems and commerce.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Ripening in nonclimacteric fruits such as grape involves complex chemical changes that have a profound influence on the accumulation of flavor and aroma compounds distinct to a particular grape genotype. In this study, proteome characterization of wine type bronze muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia cv. Carlos), primarily grown in the Southeastern United States was performed during berry ripening. Stage-specific protein expression was obtained among different stages of berries. Differential analysis showed the expression of 522 proteins that regulate diverse biological processes and metabolic pathways. Of these, 30 proteins are associated with the production of key phenolic compounds, whereas 25 are associated with the production of muscadine aroma compounds. These proteins are involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, terpene synthesis, fatty acid derived volatiles and esters that affect muscadine berry flavor and aroma characteristics. Further, gene expression analysis during ripening validated the expression pattern of 12 proteins. Catechin, epicatechin, and four stilbenes were quantified to correlate observed proteome changes. This study not only revealed biochemical changes during muscadine berry ripening but also offers indicators for marker-assisted breeding to enhance organoleptic properties of muscadine grape to improve its flavor and aroma properties.",

However, many variants are inaccessible by antibody-based methods or bottom-up tandem mass spectrometry due to their highly similar sequences. For many, the only tractable approach is with intact protein top-down tandem mass spectrometry. Here, ultra-high-resolution FT-ICR MS and MS/MS yield quantitative relative abundances of all detected HeLa H2A and H2B isobaric and isomeric variants with a label-free approach. We extend the analysis to identify and relatively quantitate 16 proteoforms from 12 sequence variants of histone H2A and 10 proteoforms of histone H2B from three other cell lines: human embryonic stem cells (WA09), U937, and a prostate cancer cell line LaZ. The top-down MS/MS approach provides a path forward for more extensive elucidation of the biological role of many previously unstudied histone variants and post-translational modifications.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) stereotypic attribution bias (SSAB) is the tendency to spontaneously generate external attributions for men's setbacks in STEM fields and to spontaneously make internal attributions for women's setbacks in STEM fields. Among samples of undergraduate STEM students, STEM settings perceived as unwelcoming to women through self-report (Study 1) and a manipulation (Study 2) were shown to predict SSAB. Among undergraduate women, experiencing the negative treatment of other women in a science setting predicted SSAB, which was negatively correlated with feelings of belonging in STEM (Study 1) and with intentions to continue in STEM after graduation (Studies 1 and 2). Research materials (e.g, data, measures, materials, etc.) used in both studies will be made available upon request to either of the first two authors. Those interested in increasing retention of women in STEM majors should develop strategies designed to reduce internal attributions for women's setbacks among women facing negative STEM environments and should cultivate a more positive climate for women in STEM fields.

      "Abstract Note" : "The Baldwin rules constitute one of the clearest examples of the success which can be obtained through the application of stereoelectronic concepts to reaction design. With thousands of examples, the predictive power of these rules is inarguable. However, time has revealed a number of exceptions and gray areas within these rules, leading to extensions and revisions. In this review, we will present an overview of how subsequent studies of ring closure have clashed with several of Baldwin's predictions, leading to the revision of some classes of ring closure (alkyne cyclizations, electrophilic closures, etc.). We also discuss for which the original rules were vague (epoxides) or absent (promoted cyclizations), and the evidence revealed since Baldwin's work that has allowed for a better understanding of these ambiguities. With the concise summation of these amendments, this review aims to present an overview of the understanding of cyclization reactions to date. (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

      "Abstract Note" : "An animal embryo cannot initiate its journey of forming a new life on its own. It must rely on maternally provided resources and inputs to kick-start its developmental process. In Drosophila, the initial polarities of the embryo along both the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes are also specified by maternal determinants. Over the past several decades, genetic and molecular studies have identified and characterized such determinants, as well as the zygotic genetic regulatory networks that control patterning in the early embryo. Extensive studies of oogenesis have also led to a detailed knowledge of the cellular and molecular interactions that control the formation of a mature egg. Despite these efforts, oogenesis and embryogenesis have been studied largely as separate problems, except for qualitative aspects with regard to maternal regulation of the asymmetric localization of maternal determinants. Can oogenesis and embryogenesis be viewed from a unified perspective at a quantitative level, and can that improve our understanding of how robust embryonic patterning is achieved? Here, we discuss the basic knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms controlling oogenesis and embryonic patterning along the AP axis. We explore properties of the maternal Bicoid gradient in relation to embryo size in search for a unified framework for robust AP patterning. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Identifying sex differences in gene expression within the brain is critical for determining why multiple neurological and behavioral disorders differentially affect males and females. Several disorders are more common or severe in males (e.g., autism and schizophrenia) or in females (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and depression). We analyzed transcriptomic data from the mouse hippocampus of six inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, DBA/2J, and PWD/Ph) to provide a perspective on differences between male and female gene expression. Our data show that 1) gene expression differences in males vs. females varies substantially across the strains, 2) only a few genes are differentially expressed across all of the strains (termed core genes), and 3) >2,600 genes differ in the individual strain comparisons (termed noncore genes). We found that DBA/2J uniquely has a substantial majority (89%) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are more highly expressed in females than in males (female-biased); 129/SvImJ has a majority (69%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in males. To gain insight into the function of the DEGs, we examined gene ontology and pathway and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment in phenotypes related to abnormal nervous system morphology and physiology, among others. In addition, several pathways are enriched significantly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with 32 genes implicated in AD, eight of which are male-biased. Three of the male-biased genes have been implicated in a neuroprotective role in AD. Our transcriptomic data provide new insight into the possible genetic bases for sex-specific susceptibility and severity of brain disorders. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:2696-2710, 2016.

A systematic study combining in situ high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), ex situ X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) techniques was carried out to gain a deep insight into the :structural evolution of P-2-Na0.66Ni0.33-xZnxMn0.67O2 (x = 0, 0.07) :during cycling. In situ HEXRD and ex situ TEM. measurements indicate that an irreversible phase transition occurs upon sodium insertion-extraction of Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2. Zinc doping of this system results in a high structural reversibility. XAFS measurements indicate that both materials are almost completely dependent on the Ni4+/Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple to provide charge/discharge capacity. SS-NMR measurements indicate that both reversible and irreversible migration of transition metal ions into the sodium layer occurs in the material at the fully charged state. The irreversible migration of transition metal ions triggers a structural distortion, leading to the observed capacity and voltage fading. Our results allow a new understanding of the importance of improving the stability of transition metal layers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We have investigated the effects of Ho-DOTA doping on the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of [1-C-13] sodium acetate using trityl OX063 free radical at 3.35 T and 1.2 K. Our results indicate that addition of 2 mM Ho-DOTA on 3 M [1-C-13] sodium acetate sample in 1 : 1 v/v glycerol : water with 15 mM trityl OX063 improves the DNP-enhanced C-13 solid-state nuclear polarization by a factor of around 2.7-fold. Similar to the Gd3+ doping effect on C-13 DNP, the locations of the positive and negative C-13 maximum polarization peaks in the C-13 microwave DNP sweep are shifted towards each other with the addition of Ho-DOTA on the DNP sample. W-band electron spin resonance (ESR) studies have revealed that while the shape and linewidth of the trityl OX063 ESR spectrum was not affected by Ho3+-doping, the electron spin-lattice relaxation time T-1 of trityl OX063 was prominently reduced at cryogenic temperatures. The reduction of trityl OX063 electron T-1 by Ho-doping is linked to the C-13 DNP improvement in light of the thermodynamic picture of DNP. Moreover, the presence of Ho-DOTA in the dissolution liquid at room temperature has negligible reduction effect on liquid-state C-13 T-1, in contrast to Gd3+-doping which drastically reduces the C-13 T-1. The results here suggest that Ho3+-doping is advantageous over Gd3+ in terms of preservation of hyperpolarized state-an important aspect to consider for in vitro and in vivo NMR or imaging (MRI) experiments where a considerable preparation time is needed to administer the hyperpolarized C-13 liquid.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Chemical potential is a fundamental property for determining thermodynamic equilibria involving exchange of molecules, such as between two phases of molecular systems. Previously, we developed the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based method for Modeling Atomistic Protein-crowder interactions (FMAP) to calculate excess chemical potentials according to the Widom insertion. Intermolecular interaction energies were expressed as correlation functions and evaluated via FFT. Here, we extend this method to calculate liquid liquid phase equilibria of macromolecular solutions. Chemical potentials are calculated by FMAP over a wide range of molecular densities, and the condition for coexistence of low-and high-density phases is determined by the Maxwell equal-area rule. When benchmarked on Lennard-Jones fluids, our method produces an accurate phase diagram at 18% of the computational cost of the current best method. Importantly, the gain in computational speed increases dramatically as the molecules become more complex, leading to many orders of magnitude in speed up for atomistically represented proteins. We demonstrate the power of FMAP by reporting the first results for the liquid liquid coexistence curve of yII-crystallin represented at the all-atom level. Our method may thus open the door to accurate determination of phase equilibria for macromolecular mixtures such as protein protein mixtures and protein RNA mixtures, that are known to undergo liquid liquid phase separation, both in vitro and in vivo.",

Ca-6(LixFe1-x)Te2N3 features isolated linear N-Fe-N units with iron in the rare Fe1+ state. The magnetic behavior of the iron site was characterized by magnetic susceptibility measurements, which indicate a very high magnetic moment (5.16 mu(B)) likely due to a high degree of spin-orbit coupling. Inherent disorder at the Fe/Li mixed site frustrates long-range communication between magnetic centers.",

Characterization by single-crystal XRD, UV-vis spectroscopy, high-frequency and-field EPR (HFEPR), magnetic susceptibility, and density functional theory (DFT) computations indicate that the (TMEDA)MnMe3 electronic structure can be described as largely square pyramidal Mn(III) centered. The paucity of manganese(III) polyalkyls and the simplicity and reactivity of this compound implicate it as a potentially useful synthetic building block.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solidstate NMR can provide orders of magnitude in signal enhancement. One of the most important aspects of obtaining efficient DNP enhancements is the optimization of the paramagnetic polarization agents used. To date, the most utilized polarization agents are nitroxide biradicals. However, the efficiency of these polarization agents is diminished when used with samples other than small molecule model compounds. We recently demonstrated the effectiveness of nitroxide labeled lipids as polarization agents for lipids and a membrane embedded peptide. Here, we systematically characterize, via electron paramagnetic (EPR), the dynamics of and the dipolar couplings between nitroxide labeled lipids under conditions relevant to DNP applications. Complemented by DNP enhanced solid-state NMR measurements at 600 MHz/395 GHz, a molecular rationale for the efficiency of nitroxide labeled lipids as DNP polarization agents is developed. Specifically, optimal DNP enhancements are obtained when the nitroxide moiety is attached to the lipid choline headgroup and local nitroxide concentrations yield an average e(-)-e(-) dipolar coupling of 47 MHz. On the basis of these measurements, we propose a framework for development of DNP polarization agents optimal for membrane protein structure determination.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Electronic relaxation dynamics and near-infrared emission of structurally precise Au-25(SC8H9)(18)(0) MPCs were studied using energy-resolved and time-resolved magneto-photoluminescence (MPL) spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out at sample temperatures spanning the range of 4.5 to 20 K following 3.1 eV laser excitation. These measurements revealed two main PL peaks detected at 1.78 and 1.98 eV. The emissive states giving rise to these peaks were characterized using magnetic circular polarized photoluminescence (MCPL) spectra, which were obtained from energy-resolved PL collected at positive and negative field polarities. Analysis of MCPL magnetization data yielded a Lande g-factor of g = 1.05 +/- 0.04 for the 1.98 eV peak and g = 1.7 +/- 0.1 for the 1.78 eV peak. The g-factor of the 1.78 eV peak suggested emission from a quartet state, which represents a high-spin configuration for this system. The time-resolved MPL data were fit to a biexpenoential decay function that included a stretch parameter. Arrhenius analysis of the 4.5 K field-dependent rate data identified an energy barrier of 0.66 +/- 0.04 meV, which was interpreted as the energy gap separating dark and bright fine structure components of the manifold of nanocluster emissive states. The temperature dependence of this energy barrier was attributed to thermal population of the upper state, reducing the effect of field-induced mixing. These data provide new insight into the optical properties of structurally precise, condensed-phase metal clusters.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Energy-related functionality and performance of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)), highly depend on their thermal transport behavior. Using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, it is discovered that the thermal conductivities of MAPbI(3) under different phases (cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic) are less than 1 W m(-1) K-1, and as low as 0.31 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature. Such ultralow thermal conductivity can be attributed to the small phonon group velocities due to their low elastic stiffness, in addition to their short phonon lifetimes (<100 ps) and mean-free-paths (<10 nm) due to the enhanced phonon-phonon scattering from highly-overlapped phonon branches. The anisotropy in thermal conductivity at lower temperatures is found to associate with preferential orientations of organic CH3NH3+ cations. Among all atomistic interactions, electrostatic interactions dominate thermal conductivities in ionic MAPbI(3) crystals. Furthermore, thermal conductivities of general hybrid perovskites MABX(3) (B = Pb, Sn; X = I, Br) have been qualitatively estimated and found that Sn- or Br-based perovskites possess higher thermal conductivities than Pb-or I-based ones due to their much higher elastic stiffness. This study inspires optimal selections and rational designs of ionic components for hybrid perovskites with desired thermal conductivity for thermally-stable photovoltaic or highly-efficient thermoelectric energy harvesting/conversion applications.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The roles of electrostatic interactions in protein folding stability have been a matter of debate, largely due to the complexity in the theoretical treatment of these interactions. We have developed computational methods for calculating electrostatic effects on protein folding stability. To rigorously test and further refine these methods, here we carried out experimental studies into electrostatic effects on the folding stability of the human 12-kD FK506 binding protein (FKBP12). This protein has a close homologue, FKBP12.6, with amino acid substitutions in only 18 of their 107 residues. Of the 18 substitutions, 8 involve charged residues. Upon mutating FKBP12 residues at these 8 positions individually into the counterparts in FKBP12.6, the unfolding free energy (Delta G(u)) of FKBP12 changed by -0.3 to 0.7 kcal/mol. Accumulating stabilizing substitutions resulted in a mutant with a 0.9 kcal/mol increase in stability. Additional charge mutations were grafted from a thermophilic homologue, MtFKBP17, which aligns to FKBP12 with 31% sequence identity over 89 positions. Eleven such charge mutations were studied, with Delta Delta G(u) varying from -2.9 to 0.1 kcal/mol. The predicted electrostatic effects by our computational methods with refinements herein had a root-mean-square deviation of 0.9 kcal/mol from the experimental Delta Delta G(u) values on 16 single mutations of FKBP12. The difference in Delta Delta G(u) between mutations grafted from FKBP12.6 and those from MtFKBP17 suggests that more distant homologues are less able to provide guidance for enhancing folding stability.",

The high processing pressure flattens nanotubes, which preferably pi-stack with the aromatic rings of Parmax chain, and accordingly improve the load transfer. Both tensile strength and Young's modulus of the thermoplastic composites increase with the alignment degree of nanotubes, and can reach 950 MPa and 94 GPa, respectively, for the composite containing 50%-stretched buckypaper. The highly aligned nanotubes also boost phonon transfer (70 Wm K-1) and the electric conductivity (425 S cm(-1)) of the composite along the alignment direction. These combined outstanding properties would enable the thermoplastic composites in wide applications as multifunctional material.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although violent offending and victimization share many features, they can affect adolescent social relationships in distinct ways. To understand these differences, we take a network approach to examine the mechanisms responsible for similarities (i.e., homophily) in violent offending and violent victimization among friends. Our goal is to determine whether the social network mechanisms that produce homophily for violent offending are similar to or different from those that produce homophily for violent victimization. By using stochastic actor-oriented modeling and two waves of friendship network data for 1,948 respondents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we examine homophily mechanisms of preference for similarity, avoidance, and influence with respect to youth violence and victimization. The results demonstrate that homophily observed for violent offending primarily reflects selection of similar others, whereas homophily observed for victimization reflects the tendency among alters to avoid victimized youth. These findings have important implications for future research and suggest that, among adolescents, violent offending and victimization homophily are the result of unique social processes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Studies have found that African Americans are more likely to perceive racial biases in the criminal justice system than are those from other racial groups. There is a limited understanding of how neighborhood social processes affect variation in these perceptions. This study formulates a series of hypotheses focused on whether perceived racial biases in the criminal justice system or perceptions of injustice vary as a function of levels of moral and legal cynicism as well as of adverse police-citizen encounters. These hypotheses are tested with multilevel regression models applied to data from a sample of 689 African Americans located in 39 neighborhoods. Findings from the regression models indicate that the positive association between structural disadvantage and perceptions of injustice is accounted for by moral and legal cynicism. Furthermore, adverse police encounters significantly increase perceptions of injustice; controlling for these encounters reduces the strength of the association between cynicism and injustice perceptions. Finally, the findings reveal that cynicism intensifies the association between adverse police encounters and perceptions of criminal injustice. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for research regarding perceived biases in the criminal justice system and neighborhood social processes.",

We conclude by drawing attention to how the incorporation of genetic variables into prevention designs could help identify individual variability in program effectiveness and thereby increase program success rates. Policy ImplicationsEvidence-based prevention science seeking to reduce crime and other related behavioral disorders has made significant progress in the identification of risk factors involved in the development of antisocial behavior, as well as in the creation and testing of such programs intended to target these risk factors. Nonetheless, issues of program effectiveness remain as individual responsivity to prevention interventions is often overlooked. Paralleling the movement toward evidence-based prevention science, but largely isolated from such efforts, has been an area of research devoted toward identifying how genetic factors interact with social environments to influence behavioral outcomes. By joining these two fields, genetically informed prevention interventions have the potential to increase our understanding of the causes of crime and other problem behaviors, as well as to help identify individual variability in program effectiveness.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Research SummaryWe conducted a systematic review of recidivism outcomes for juveniles transferred to adult court, incorporating meta-analytic techniques. Nine studiesbased on nine statistically independent samplesmet the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis suggests that juvenile transfer had no statistically significant effect on recidivism. However, the distribution of effect sizes was highly heterogeneous and, given the strength of the research designs, suggests that in some instances transfer may decrease recidivism and in others may increase it. Policy ImplicationsThe practice of transferring juvenile offenders to the criminal justice system has decreased from its peak in the mid-1990s, but it is still estimated to affect tens of thousands of juveniles in the United States each year. As such, a coherent rationale for transfer policy is needed. The present review casts doubt on one prominent justification for transfer, that it creates a specific deterrent effect for transferred juveniles. Indeed, the results suggest that transfer may in fact increase offending. More generally, the results underscore the need for more high-quality research to identify the conditions under which transfer may decrease or increase recidivism.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Research SummaryThe juvenile court was established to help children through the use of punishment and rehabilitation and, in so doing, save them from a life of crime and disadvantage. Diversion programs and policies emerged in the 1970s as one way to achieve this goal. Despite concerns about its potential harm, diversion became increasingly popular in subsequent decades. We examine the logic of a prominent contemporary diversion effort, civil citation, to illuminate tensions inherent to traditional and contemporary diversion. We then review extant evidence on traditional diversion efforts, examine civil citation laws, and identify the salience of both traditional and contemporary, police-centered diversion efforts for youth and the juvenile court. The analysis highlights that diversion may help children but that it also may harm them. It highlights that the risk of net-widening for the police and the court is considerable. And it highlights the importance of, and need for, research on the use and effects of diversion and the conditions under which it may produce benefits and avoid harms. Policy ImplicationsThis article recommends a more tempered embrace of diversion and a fuller embrace of research-guided efforts to achieve the juvenile court's ideals. Diversion may be effective under certain conditions, but these conditions need to be identified and then met.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Copper(II) acetate is a frequent empirical choice of the copper source in copper(II)-mediated redox reactions. The effect of the acetate counterion appears crucial but has not been adequately investigated. Herein, we report that copper(II) acetate catalyzes the aerobic dehydrogenation of chelating aromatic secondary amines. The chemoselectivity of acetate and chelating amines in this reaction provides a unique opportunity for a mechanistic study. The progression of this homogeneous reaction is monitored by using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, and manometry. The kinetic dependence on the amine substrate, copper(II), and acetate counterion, together with the results of kinetic isotope and substituent effect experiments, suggests that acetate acts both as a bridging ligand of a dinuclear catalytic center for mediating two-electron transfer steps and as a base in the turnover-limiting C-H bond-cleavage step. Upon including 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as a surrogate base, DBU and acetate act in a complementary manner to enable a rapid, catalytic dehydrogenation reaction of a chelating secondary amine substrate. Finally, the contrasting reactivities between copper(II) acetate (promoting two-electron transfer) and copper(II) perchlorate (promoting single-electron transfer) underscores how a counterion could completely alter the mechanistic pathway of a copper-mediated oxidation reaction.",

Using the tunable nature of the metal-ion nodes in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we present an in situ reduction and crystallization route for preparing MOFs and doping Eu2+/Eu3+ with a controlled ratio. These materials exhibit rich photoluminescence, including intrinsicand sensitized-emissions of Eu2+/Eu3+, and long-lived luminescence from charge transfer. Color rendering can be easily achieved by fine-tuning the valence states of Eu. A linear relation between temperature and the intensity ratio of Eu2+/Eu3+ emissions provides outstanding properties for applications as self-calibrated luminescent thermometers with a wide working temperature range. Further incorporation of Tb3+ into the MOFs results in white light, utilizing all Eu2+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ emissions in a single crystalline lattice.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The experimental binding energies of single-particle and single-hole neutron states belonging to neutron shells that extend from N = 126-184 and 82-126, respectively, have been reproduced by solving the Schrodinger equation with a potential that has two components: the generalized Woods-Saxon (GWS) potential and the spin-orbit (SO) coupling term. The GWS potential contains the traditional WS potential plus a term (SU) whose intensity reaches a maximum in the nuclear surface. Our results indicate the existence of an explicit relationship between the strength of the SU potential and the orbital angular momentum quantum number l of the state. This dependence has been used to make reasonable predictions for the excitation energy centroids of states located inside and outside the neutron shells investigated. Comparisons are made with results reported in previous investigations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Crocodylians undergo substantial increases in size during ontogeny. The American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, in particular traverses nearly four orders of body mass between hatching and senescence. Accompanying such changes are modifications in rostrodental morphology and feeding capabilities that facilitate major shifts in diet. How such anatomical changes relate to ecological niche occupation across sizes is not well understood. In this study, we focused on the effects of ontogenetic changes on the force-generating mechanisms for jaw closure to assess the impacts of scaling on feeding biomechanics. We developed dissection-based, musculoskeletal models of maximum bite-force generation throughout ontogeny and compared and tested their veracity with data from an A.mississippiensis developmental series, for which bite forces were directly measured. Through examinations of the scaling patterns within the parameters of our models, we discuss how muscle pennation and positive allometry in the American alligator jaw adductor system facilitate capture strategies and oral processing of prey, and contribute to developmental niche shifts in this large-bodied taxon. On the basis of conservation of the crocodylian jaw adductor system, we argue that our findings are broadly applicable to crown Crocodylia and reflect an important, but often overlooked, aspect of the crocodylian feeding ecomorphology: littoral, sit-and-wait predation is enhanced by posteroventrally displaced, exceptionally large, and forceful ventral pterygoideus muscles, in particular. Future studies on the ontogeny and evolution of feeding in crocodylians should not neglect the functional and ecological implications of these muscles' contributions to diet.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) go beyond the stabilization of the resting potential and regulate biochemical pathways, regulate intracellular signaling, and detect energy homeostasis. Because targeted deletion and pharmacological block of the Kv1.3 channel protein produce marked changes in metabolism, resistance to diet-induced obesity, and changes in olfactory structure and function, this investigation explored Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation to regulate Kv1.3 channel density. Heterologous coexpression of Nedd4-2 ligase and Kv1.3 in HEK 293 cells reduced Kv1.3 current density without modulation of kinetic properties as measured by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Modulation of current density was dependent on ligase activity and was lost through point mutation of cysteine 938 in the catalytic site of the ligase (Nedd4-2CS). Incorporation of adaptor protein Grb10 relieved Nedd4-2-induced current suppression as did application of the proteasome inhibitor Mg-132. SDS-PAGE and immunoprecipitation strategies demonstrated a channel/adaptor/ligase signalplex. Pixel immunodensity was reduced for Kv1.3 in the presence of Nedd4-2, which was eliminated upon additional incorporation of Grb10. We confirmed Nedd4-2/Grb10 coimmunoprecipitation and observed an increased immunodensity for Nedd4-2 in the presence of Kv1.3 plus Grb10, regardless of whether the catalytic site was active. Kv1.3/Nedd4-2 were reciprocally coimmunoprecipated, whereby mutation of the COOH-terminal, SH3-recognition (493-498), or ubiquitination sites on Kv1.3 (lysines 467, 476, 498) retained coimmunoprecipitation, while the latter prevented the reduction in channel density. A model is presented for which an atypical interaction outside the canonical PY motif may permit channel/ligase interaction to lead to protein degradation and reduced current density, which can involve Nedd4-2/Grb10 interactions to disrupt Kv1.3 loss of current density.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Systematics at the species level is still marked by theoretical and empirical tensions amongst the desires to identify geographical lineages, delimit species, and estimate their relationships. These goals are often confounded because each relies, at least to some extent, on the others being known. However, recently developed methods can simultaneously address all three. Furthermore, next-generation genomic sequencing allows us to generate large-scale molecular data sets to examine variation within species at a fine scale. Finally, a renaissance in morphological species validation allows us to integrate historical species definitions with coalescent models for species delimitation. Here, we investigate the applicability of these methods in an empirical case, in the Nearctic snake genus Storeria. Integrating trait data into species delimitation reduces the number of species delimited from molecular data alone. Whereas molecular data support eight distinct species-level lineages, including morphological data reduces this to four. The taxa Storeria dekayi, Storeria occipitomaculata, Storeria storerioides, and Storeria victa are considered distinct, monotypic species, with no subspecies recognized. We highlight the need for careful assessment of species delimitation, combining both computational genetic methods as well as traditional character-based descriptions. It is now possible to identify phylogeographical lineages, delimit species using molecular and morphological data, and estimate their relationships in a single coherent set of analyses. Moving forward, this will allow for more rapid and objective assessments of cryptic diversity at the species level. (C) 2016 The Linnean Society of London",

      "Abstract Note" : "In a recent paper, Croson etal. () experimentally study three weakest link games with multiple symmetric equilibria. They demonstrate that static concepts based on the Nash equilibrium (including multiple Nash equilibria, quantal response equilibria, and equilibrium selection by risk and payoff dominance) cannot successfully capture the observed treatment differences. Using Reinhard Selten's impulse response dynamics, we derive a proposition that provides a theoretical ranking of contribution levels in the weakest link games. We show that the predicted ranking of treatment outcomes is fully consistent with the observed data. In addition, we demonstrate that the impulse response dynamics perform well in tracking average contributions over time. We conclude that Reinhard Selten's impulse response dynamics provide an extremely valuable behavioral approach that is not only capable of resolving the indecisiveness of static approaches in games with many equilibria, but that can also be used to track the development of choices over time in games with repeated interaction.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Arctic winter precipitation is projected to increase with global warming, but some areas will experience decreases in snow accumulation. Although Arctic CH4 emissions may represent a significant climate forcing feedback, long-term impacts of changes in snow accumulation on CH4 fluxes remain uncertain. We measured ecosystem CH4 fluxes and soil CH4 and CO2 concentrations and C-13 composition to investigate the metabolic pathways and transport mechanisms driving moist acidic tundra CH4 flux over the growing season (Jun-Aug) after 18years of experimental snow depth increases and decreases. Deeper snow increased soil wetness and warming, reducing soil %O-2 levels and increasing thaw depth. Soil moisture, through changes in soil %O-2 saturation, determined predominance of methanotrophy or methanogenesis, with soil temperature regulating the ecosystem CH4 sink or source strength. Reduced snow (RS) increased the fraction of oxidized CH4 (Fox) by 75-120% compared to Ambient, switching the system from a small source to a net CH4 sink (21 +/- 2 and -31 +/- 1mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at Ambient and RS). Deeper snow reduced Fox by 35-40% and 90-100% in medium- (MS) and high- (HS) snow additions relative to Ambient, contributing to increasing the CH4 source strength of moist acidic tundra (464 +/- 15 and 3561 +/- 97mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at MS and HS). Decreases in Fox with deeper snow were partly due to increases in plant-mediated CH4 transport associated with the expansion of tall graminoids. Deeper snow enhanced CH4 production within newly thawed soils, responding mainly to soil warming rather than to increases in acetate fermentation expected from thaw-induced increases in SOC availability. Our results suggest that increased winter precipitation will increase the CH4 source strength of Arctic tundra, but the resulting positive feedback on climate change will depend on the balance between areas with more or less snow accumulation than they are currently facing.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Recent syntheses on the evolutionary causes of dispersal have focused on dispersal as a direct adaptation, but many traits that influence dispersal have other functions, raising the question: when is dispersal for' dispersal? We review and critically evaluate the ecological causes of selection on traits that give rise to dispersal in marine and terrestrial organisms. In the sea, passive dispersal is relatively easy and specific morphological, behavioural, and physiological adaptations for dispersal are rare. Instead, there may often be selection to limit dispersal. On land, dispersal is relatively difficult without specific adaptations, which are relatively common. Although selection for dispersal is expected in both systems and traits leading to dispersal are often linked to fitness, systems may differ in the extent to which dispersal in nature arises from direct selection for dispersal or as a by-product of selection on traits with other functions. Our analysis highlights incompleteness of theories that assume a simple and direct relationship between dispersal and fitness, not just insofar as they ignore a vast array of taxa in the marine realm, but also because they may be missing critically important effects of traits influencing dispersal in all realms.",

The second objective was to determine whether cardiovascular or respiratory cases experience hotter and more humid indoor conditions as compared to controls. Paramedics carried portable sensors into buildings where patients received care to passively monitor indoor temperature and humidity. The case-control study compared 338 respiratory cases, 291 cardiovascular cases, and 471 controls. Intuitively, warmer and sunnier outdoor conditions increased indoor temperatures. Older patients who received emergency care tended to occupy warmer buildings. Indoor-specific humidity levels quickly adjusted to outdoor conditions. Indoor heat and humidity exposure above a 26 degrees C threshold increased (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.98-2.68, P=0.056), but not significantly, the proportion of respiratory cases. Indoor heat exposures were similar between cardiovascular cases and controls.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Lobomycosis (lacaziosis) is a chronic, granulomatous, fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of humans and dolphins. To date, the causative agent, the yeast-like organism Lacazia loboi, has not been grown in the laboratory, and there have been no recent reports describing attempts to culture the organism. As a result, studies on the efficacy of therapeutics and potential environmental reservoirs have not been conducted. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to utilize both classical and novel microbiological methods in order to stimulate growth of Lacazia cells collected from dolphin lesions. This included the experimental inoculation of novel media, cell culture, and the use of artificial skin matrices. Although unsuccessful, the methods and results of this study provide important insight into new approaches that could be utilized in future investigations of this elusive organism.",

      "Abstract Note" : "It is well-known that physical laws for large chaotic dynamical systems are revealed statistically. The main concern of this manuscript is numerical methods for dissipative chaotic infinite dimensional dynamical systems that are able to capture the stationary statistical properties of the underlying dynamical systems. We first survey results on temporal and spatial approximations that enjoy the desired properties. We then present a new result on fully discretized approximations of infinite dimensional dissipative chaotic dynamical systems that are able to capture asymptotically the stationary statistical properties. The main ingredients in ensuring the convergence of the long time statistical properties of the numerical schemes are: (1) uniform dissipativity of the scheme in the sense that the union of the global attractors of the numerical approximations is pre-compact in the phase space; (2) convergence of the solutions of the numerical scheme to the solution of the continuous system on the unit time interval [0, 1] modulo an initial layer, uniformly with respect to initial data from the union of the global attractors. The two conditions are reminiscent of the Lax equivalence theorem where stability and consistency are needed for the convergence of a numerical scheme. Applications to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic box are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Self-poling of ferroelectric films, i.e., a preferred, uniform direction of the ferroelectric polarization in as-grown samples is often observed yet poorly understood despite its importance for device applications. The multiferroic perovskite BiFeO3, which crystallizes in two distinct structural polymorphs depending on applied epitaxial strain, is well known to exhibit self-poling. This study investigates the effect of self-poling on the monoclinic domain configuration and the switching properties of the two polymorphs of BiFeO3 (R' and T') in thin films grown on LaAlO3 substrates with slightly different La0.3Sr0.7MnO3 buffer layers. This study shows that the polarization state formed during the growth acts as \"imprint\" on the polarization and that switching the polarization away from this self-poled direction can only be done at the expense of the sample's monoclinic domain configuration. The observed reduction of the monoclinic domain size is largely reversible; hence, the domain size is restored when the polarization is switched back to its original orientation. This is a direct consequence of the growth taking place in the polar phase (below T-c). Switching the polarization away from the preferred configuration, in which defects and domain patterns synergistically minimize the system's energy, leads to a domain state with smaller (and more highly strained and distorted) monoclinic domains.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We consider a Leray model with a deconvolution-based indicator function for the simulation of incompressible fluid flow at moderately large Reynolds number (in the range of a few thousands) with under-resolved meshes. For the implementation of the model, we adopt a three-step algorithm called evolve-filter-relax that requires (i) the solution of a Navier-Stokes problem, (ii) the solution of a Stokes-like problem to filter the Navier-Stokes velocity field, and (iii) a final relaxation step. We take advantage of a reformulation of the evolve-filter-relax algorithm as an operator-splitting method to analyze the impact of the filter on the final solution versus a direct simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, we provide some direction for tuning the parameters involved in the model based on physical and numerical arguments. Our approach is validated against experimental data for fluid flow in an idealized medical device (consisting of a conical convergent, a narrow throat, and a sudden expansion, as recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Numerical results are in good quantitative agreement with the measured axial components of the velocity and pressures for two different flow rates corresponding to turbulent regimes, even for meshes with a mesh size more than 40 times larger than the smallest turbulent scale. After several numerical experiments, we perform a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the computed solution to the parameters involved in the model. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Despite the possibility of hydrogen abstraction in the fragmenting step, followed by loss of R-OH, beta-scission is preferred for the formation of alkoxy radicals. For the first time, the C-O radical was intermolecularly trapped using a silyl enol ether. Various C-X fragmenting groups were explored as possible traceless directing groups for the preparation of extended polyaromatics. Computational evidence shows that a combination of aromatization, steric and stereoelectronic effects assists the fragmentation to alkoxy radicals. Additionally, a new through-space interaction was discovered between O and Sn in the fragmentation as a specific transition state stabilizing effect.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Amorphous hydrated complexes of the polyelectrolytes poly (styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) were doped with the spin-5/2 ion Mn2+. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of the Mn2+ spins within these stoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) revealed an octahedral coordination environment, similar to that observed in aqueous solutions of Mn2+. This octahedral symmetry of the [Mn(H2O)(6)](2+) complexes, observed in fully hydrated PECs, is somewhat distorted because of the wide range of ion pairs possible with the sulfonate group on PSS. As the Mn2+ concentration was increased, the linewidths broadened, indicating the dominance of dipolar broadening over exchange narrowing in determining the linewidths; that is, any exchange narrowing was masked by the large dipolar broadening. The calculated linewidths were used to estimate the strengths of the dipolar interactions, and hence the distances between the Mn2+ spins, on the basis of a simple model of regularly spaced spins. The distances calculated by this method were roughly comparable to the geometric average distances calculated on the basis of the Mn2+ concentrations and densities of the doped PEC samples. From a comparison of their EPR spectra, the ion environments in the doped, fully hydrated PECs were found to be similar to those in hydrated classical ion exchange resins. EPR spectra before and after drying of the PECs indicate the replacement of octahedrally coordinated water by oxide anions from the polyanion chain and the corresponding loss of the symmetric environment of Mn2+ ions.",

Herein, we show how the crystal facet dependence of the pairwise selectivity of the semihydrogenation of propyne, when interpreted in the context of recent DFT calculations, can reveal new details about the hydrogenation mechanism. The pairwise selectivity of propyne hydrogenation is strongly shape dependent, which reflects the surface atom arrangements exposed on the different facets of CeO2 nanocrystals. In this first demonstration of a catalyst shape dependence of PHIP, an unprecedented pairwise selectivity of 8.1% is observed over oxygen-deficient facets of rods, whereas oxygen-rich octahedra facets deliver only 1.6% selectivity. The PHIP data are consistent with a concerted addition pathway through a six-membered-ring transition state, as predicted in the DFT study.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We report the first application of a new mass spectrometry technique (gas chromatography combined to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry, GC/APCI-MS/MS) for fingerprinting a crude oil and environmental samples from the largest accidental marine oil spill in history (the Macondo oil spill, the Gulf of Mexico, 2010). The fingerprinting of the oil spill is based on a trace analysis of petroleum biomarkers (steranes, cliasteranes, and pentacyclic triterpanes) naturally occurring in crude oil. GC/APCI enables soft ionization of petroleum compounds that form abundant molecular ions without (or little) fragmentation. The ability to operate the instrument simultaneously in several tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) modes (e.g., full scan, product ion scan, reaction monitoring) significantly improves structural information content and sensitivity of analysis. For fingerprinting the oil spill, we constructed diagrams and conducted correlation studies that measure the similarity between environmental samples and enable us to differentiate the Macondo oil spill from other sources.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Aerosol iron was examined in Saharan dust plumes using a combination of iron near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and wet-chemical techniques. Aerosol samples were collected at three sites located in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and Bermuda to characterize iron at different atmospheric transport lengths and time scales. Iron(III) oxides were a component of aerosols at all sampling sites and dominated the aerosol iron in Mediterranean samples. In Atlantic samples, iron(II and III) sulfate, iron(III) phosphate, and iron(II) silicates were also contributors to aerosol composition. With increased atmospheric transport time, iron(II) sulfates are found to become more abundant, aerosol iron oxidation state became more reduced, and aerosol acidity increased. Atmospheric processing including acidic reactions and photoreduction likely influence the form of iron minerals and oxidation state in Saharan dust aerosols and contribute to increases in aerosol-iron solubility.",

The crystal structures of SCU-6 and SCU-7 are layers built with tetranuclear and dinuclear uranyl clusters, respectively. Exchangeable halide anions are present in the interlaminar spaces balancing the positive charge of layers in SCU-7. Therefore, SCU-7 is able to effectively remove perrhenate anions from aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the H2PO4--exchanged SCU-7 material exhibits a moderate proton conductivity of 8.70 X 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 50 degrees C and 90% relative humidity, representing nearly 80 times enhancement compared to the original material.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Magnetic properties of the series of three linear, trimetallic chain compounds Cr2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, 1, Mo2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, 2, and W2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, 3 (dpa = 2,2'-dipyridylamido), have been studied using variable-temperature dc and ac magnetometry and high-frequency EPR spectroscopy. All three compounds possess an S = 2 electronic ground state arising from the terminal Cr2+ ion, which exhibits slow magnetic relaxation under an applied magnetic field, as evidenced by ac magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements. The slow relaxation stems from the existence of an easy-axis magnetic anisotropy, which is bolstered by the axial symmetry of the compounds and has been quantified through rigorous high-frequency EPR measurements. The magnitude of D in these compounds increases when heavier ions are substituted into the trimetallic chain; thus D = -1.640, -2.187, and -3.617 cm(-1) for Cr2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, Mo2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, and W2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2, respectively. Additionally, the D value measured for W2Cr(dpa)(4)Cl-2 is the largest yet reported for a high-spin Cr2+ system. While earlier studies have demonstrated that ligands containing heavy atoms can enhance magnetic anisotropy, this is the first report of this phenomenon using heavy metal atoms as \"ligands\".",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hindbrain glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) neurons project to numerous forebrain areas, including the lateral septum (LS). Using a fluorescently labeled GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, Exendin 4 (Ex4), we demonstrated GLP-1 receptor binding throughout the rat LS. We examined the feeding effects of Ex4 and the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin (9-39) (Ex9) at doses subthreshold for effect when delivered to the lateral ventricle. Intra-LS Ex4 suppressed overnight chow and high-fat diet (HFD) intake, and Ex9 increased chow and HFD intake relative to vehicle. During 2-h tests, intra-LS Ex9 significantly increased 0.25 M sucrose and 4% corn oil. Ex4 can cause nausea, but intra-LS administration of Ex4 did not induce pica. Furthermore, intra-LS Ex4 had no effect on anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. We investigated the role of LS GLP-1R in motivation for food by examining operant responding for sucrose on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule, with and without a nutrient preload to maximize GLP-1 neuron activation. The preload strongly suppressed PR responding, but blockade of GLP-1R in the intermediate subdivision of the LS did not affect motivation for sucrose under either load condition. The ability of the nutrient load to suppress subsequent chow intake was significantly attenuated by intermediate LS Ex9 treatment. By contrast, blockade of GLP-1R in the dorsal subdivision of the LS increased both PR responding and overnight chow intake. Together, these studies suggest that endogenous activity of GLP-1R in the LS influence feeding, and dLS GLP-1Rs, in particular, play a role in motivation.",

Seasonal differences in size and reproductive condition of captured or confiscated specimens were compared. The SPUE differed significantly with season, increasing in late spring and peaking during the austral summer months. A significant effect was observed in the number of fish relative to the lunar cycle. All females sampled during the summer were spawning capable, while all those sampled during other seasons were either regressing or regenerating. What these data strongly infer is that the E. itajara spawning aggregation sites have been located in the southern state of Parana and the northern state of Santa Catarina and summer is the most likely spawning season. Size frequency distributions, abundance and reproductive state were estimated and correlated with environmental variables. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles",

Despite the common structure, each FP has unique properties. Thus, there is no single 'best' FP for every circumstance, and each FP has advantages and disadvantages. To guide decisions about which FP is right for a given application, we have quantitatively characterized the brightness, photostability, pH stability and monomeric properties of more than 40 FPs to enable straightforward and direct comparison between them.

      "Abstract Note" : "This essay discusses the use of big data analytics (BDA) as a strategy of enquiry for advancing information systems (IS) research. In broad terms, we understand BDA as the statistical modelling of large, diverse, and dynamic data sets of user-generated content and digital traces. BDA, as a new paradigm for utilising big data sources and advanced analytics, has already found its way into some social science disciplines. Sociology and economics are two examples that have successfully harnessed BDA for scientific enquiry. Often, BDA draws on methodologies and tools that are unfamiliar for some IS researchers (e.g., predictive modelling, natural language processing). Following the phases of a typical research process, this article is set out to dissect BDA's challenges and promises for IS research, and illustrates them by means of an exemplary study about predicting the helpfulness of 1.3 million online customer reviews. In order to assist IS researchers in planning, executing, and interpreting their own studies, and evaluating the studies of others, we propose an initial set of guidelines for conducting rigorous BDA studies in IS.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Orange-red fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in biomedical research for multiplexed epifluorescence microscopy with GFP-based probes, but their different excitation requirements make multiplexing with new advanced microscopy methods difficult. Separately, orange-red FPs are useful for deep-tissue imaging in mammals owing to the relative tissue transmissibility of orange-red light, but their dependence on illumination limits their sensitivity as reporters in deep tissues. Here we describe CyOFP1, a bright, engineered, orange-red FP that is excitable by cyan light. We show that CyOFP1 enables single-excitation multiplexed imaging with GFP-based probes in single-photon and two-photon microscopy, including time-lapse imaging in light-sheet systems. CyOFP1 also serves as an efficient acceptor for resonance energy transfer from the highly catalytic blue-emitting luciferase NanoLuc. An optimized fusion of CyOFP1 and NanoLuc, called Antares, functions as a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter in vivo, producing substantially brighter signals from deep tissues than firefly luciferase and other bioluminescent proteins.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This paper summarizes the development of a new method for screening petroleum crude oils for the presence of \"ARN\" tetraprotic acids, based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). When slurried with crude oils, MIPs imprinted by a suite of ARN acid standards selectively bind to ARN acids. The strong interaction enables removal of most of the crude oil by several toluene washes. The ARN acids are then recovered by washing with a mixture of 5% formic acid in methanol/toluene. Our results show that the sample load directly impacts the amount of ARN acids recovered: a higher sample load lowers the detectable concentration range. MIPs offer a quick and sensitive method to screen crude oils for ARN acid present at low concentrations (sub-parts per million). This study also illustrates the capabilities of MIPs for isolating members of an entire class of compounds.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Externalizing proneness, or trait disinhibition, is a concept relevant to multiple high-impact disorders involving impulsive-aggressive behavior. Its mechanisms remain disputed: major models posit hyperresponsive reward circuitry or heightened threat-system reactivity as sources of disinhibitory tendencies. This study evaluated alternative possibilities by examining relations between trait disinhibition and brain reactivity during preparation for and processing of visual affective stimuli. Forty females participated in a functional neuroimaging procedure with stimuli presented in blocks containing either pleasurable or aversive pictures interspersed with neutral, with each picture preceded by a preparation signal. Preparing to view elicited activation in regions including nucleus accumbens, whereas visual regions and bilateral amygdala were activated during viewing of emotional pictures. High disinhibition predicted reduced nucleus accumbens activation during preparation within pleasant/neutral picture blocks, along with enhanced amygdala reactivity during viewing of pleasant and aversive pictures. Follow-up analyses revealed that the augmented amygdala response was related to reduced preparatory activation. Findings indicate that participants high in disinhibition are less able to process implicit cues and mentally prepare for upcoming stimuli, leading to limbic hyperreactivity during processing of actual stimuli. This outcome is helpful for integrating findings from studies suggesting reward-system hyperreactivity and others suggesting threat-system hyperreactivity as mechanisms for externalizing proneness.",

Topics included availability of specific asthma management modalities, compliance with national guidelines, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and efforts toward performance improvement. Setting: Emergency departments at 10 large hospitals in the state of Florida. Participants: Clinical care providers and health administrators from participating hospitals. Main Outcome Measures: Compliance with national asthma care guideline standards, provision of specific recommended treatment modalities and resources, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and engagement in performance improvement efforts. Results: Our results suggest inconsistency among sampled Florida hospitals' adherence to national standards for treatment of asthma in EDs. Several hospitals were refining their emergency care protocols to incorporate guideline recommendations. Despite a lack of formal ED protocols in some hospitals, adherence to national guidelines for emergency care nonetheless remained robust for patient education and medication prescribing, but it was weaker for formal care planning and medical follow-up. Conclusions: Identified deficiencies in emergency asthma care present a number of opportunities for strategic mitigation of identified gaps. We conclude with suggestions to help Florida hospitals achieve success with ED asthma care reform. Team-based learning activities may offer an optimal strategy for sharing and implementing best practices.",

We report characterization of the FN of a designed purely symmetric beta-trefoil protein by phi-value analysis. We compare the structure and folding properties of key foldable intermediates along the evolutionary trajectory of the beta-trefoil. The results show structural acquisition of the FN during gene fusion events, incorporating novel turn structure created by gene fusion. Furthermore, the FN is adjusted by circular permutation in response to destabilizing functional mutation. FN plasticity by way of circular permutation is made possible by the intrinsic C-3 cyclic symmetry of the b-trefoil architecture, identifying a possible selective advantage that helps explain the prevalence of cyclic structural symmetry in the proteome.",

This research examines the association between the 5 major dimensions of personality and cognitive function and decline in older adulthood and includes a meta-analysis of published studies. Personality traits, objective and subjective memory, and cognitive status were collected in a large national sample (N = 13,987) with a 4-year follow-up period. For each trait, the meta-analysis pooled results from up to 5 prospective studies to examine personality and change in global cognition. Higher Neuroticism was associated with worse performance on all cognitive measures and greater decline in memory, whereas higher Conscientiousness and Openness were associated with better memory performance concurrently and less decline over time. All traits were associated with subjective memory. Higher Conscientiousness and lower Extraversion were associated with better cognitive status and less decline. Although modest, these associations were generally larger than that of hypertension, diabetes, history of psychological treatment, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. The meta-analysis supported the association between Neuroticism and Conscientiousness and cognitive decline. Personality is associated with cognitive decline in older adults, with effects comparable to established clinical and lifestyle risk factors.",

The present study examined whether subjective age is associated with memory level and changes, as indexed by measures of immediate and delayed recall. A complementary purpose was to test the mediating role of depressive symptoms and physical activity in the relation between subjective age and memory changes. Participants were drawn from three waves of the Health and Retirement Study. Subjective age, baseline memory measures, and covariates were assessed during the 2008 wave (N = 5809), depressive symptoms and physical activity were assessed again in the 2010 wave, and the follow-up memory measures were assessed in the 2012 wave. Regression analyses that included demographic, metabolic, and vascular covariates revealed that a younger subjective age at baseline was associated with better concurrent performance and with slower decline in immediate and delayed recall. Bootstrap procedures indicated that fewer depressive symptoms mediated these associations. Additional analyses revealed that memory level and change were unrelated to changes in subjective age. Beyond chronological age, the subjective experience of age is associated with cognitive aging.",

Aliquots of fractions were pooled into fewer, more complex samples. The unfractionated lysate, fractions, and pooled fractions were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Samples consisting of many individual fractions had more protein identifications, greater protein sequence coverage, and quantified proteins with more spectral counts than protein extract that was unfractionated or pooled into fewer LC-MS/MS samples. Additionally, prefractionation reduced the median CV for spectral counts asmuch as 33%. However, the relative gain in proteome resolution was found to saturate with increasing fractionation extent. This study demonstrates how prefractionation by offline IEF can improve the resolution of proteomic investigations of the mouse hippocampus, and that a data-driven pooling methodology can reduce excessive and cost-ineffective fractionation.",

MethodInterview and questionnaire data come from four studies of 243 women with bulimia nervosa (n = 141) or purging disorder (n = 102). Hierarchical linear regression tested if the largest reported episode size, coded in kilocalories, explained additional variance in eating disorder features, psychopathology, personality traits, and impairment, holding constant LOC eating frequency, age, and body mass index (BMI). Analyses also tested if episode size moderated the association between LOC eating and these variables. ResultsHolding LOC constant, episode size explained significant variance in disinhibition, trait anxiety, and eating disorder-related impairment. Episode size moderated the association of LOC eating with purging frequency and depressive symptoms, such that in the presence of larger eating episodes, LOC eating was more closely associated with these features. Neither episode size nor its interaction with LOC explained additional variance in BMI, hunger, restraint, shape concerns, state anxiety, negative urgency, or global functioning. DiscussionTaken together, results support the incremental validity of the size criterion, in addition to and in combination with LOC eating, for defining binge-eating episodes in purging syndromes. Future research should examine the predictive validity of episode size in both purging and nonpurging eating disorders (e.g., binge eating disorder) to inform nosological schemes.

      "Abstract Note" : "Drone surveillance can be regarded either as a justifiable, impartial practice serving the interests of all or as an oppressive technique catering to the interests of some at the expense of others. This analysis is an effort to weigh the ethical prospects and problems in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by asking whether surveillance of civilians is ethical. To address this question, classical philosophical and modern behavioral approaches to ethics are used. The inquiry begins with the importance of the issue, followed by its evolution and current status. After describing the method of analysis, the article examines arguments for and against domestic monitoring. The unique utility of drones can accomplish much in the public interest while simultaneously creating moral hazards. The conclusion discusses accountability standards, model legislation provisions, and regulatory criteria for aerial vehicle surveillance.",

In so doing, I synthesise personal history with extant research on chronic illness by analysing ways in which my experiences reflect and reject social norms. I also incorporate perspectives from research on aspirations and attainment, and the mental health consequences of cyclical disappointment. By weaving together lessons from each of these literatures, I articulate an integrative psychosocial understanding of the micro-level processes and experiences involved in illness management as well as the ways that experiences of illness management may require integration of varied sociological insights concerning health. In closing, I draw out theoretical implications for understanding the integration and variation of insights from many areas of health research in the lived experiences of people with chronic conditions.

      "Abstract Note" : "With anthropogenic impacts rapidly advancing into deeper waters, there is growing interest in establishing deep-sea marine protected areas (MPAs) or reserves. Reserve design depends on estimates of connectivity and scales of dispersal for the taxa of interest. Deep-sea taxa are hypothesized to disperse greater distances than shallow-water taxa, which implies that reserves would need to be larger in size and networks could be more widely spaced; however, this paradigm has not been tested. We compiled population genetic studies of deep-sea fauna and estimated dispersal distances for 51 studies using a method based on isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates of dispersal distance ranged from 0.24 km to 2028 km with a geometric mean of 33.2 km and differed in relation to taxonomic and life-history factors as well as several study parameters. Dispersal distances were generally greater for fishes than invertebrates with the Mollusca being the least dispersive sampled phylum. Species that are pelagic as adults were more dispersive than those with sessile or sedentary lifestyles. Benthic species from soft-substrate habitats were generally less dispersive than species from hard substrate, demersal or pelagic habitats. As expected, species with pelagic and/or feeding (planktotrophic) larvae were more dispersive than other larval types. Many of these comparisons were confounded by taxonomic or other life-history differences (e.g. fishes being more dispersive than invertebrates) making any simple interpretation difficult. Our results provide the first rough estimate of the range of dispersal distances in the deep sea and allow comparisons to shallow-water assemblages. Overall, dispersal distances were greater for deeper taxa, although the differences were not large (0.3-0.6 orders of magnitude between means), and imbalanced sampling of shallow and deep taxa complicates any simple interpretation. Our analyses suggest the scales of dispersal and connectivity for reserve design in the deep sea might be comparable to or slightly larger than those in shallow water. Deep-sea reserve design will need to consider the enormous variety of taxa, life histories, hydrodynamics, spatial configuration of habitats and patterns of species distributions. The many caveats of our analyses provide a strong impetus for substantial future efforts to assess connectivity of deep-sea species from a variety of habitats, taxonomic groups and depth zones.",

A treatment effect model is formulated and estimated to examine the relationship between corporate types and chances of obtaining external financing. The estimation takes into account self-selection bias associated with LFO choices. This article finds that LFO choices mainly affect small corporations' access to external equity capital, but have no significant impact on loan financing. Specifically, when a small corporation selects the C corporate legal form, the probability of obtaining new external equity is eight times higher compared to when it selects the S corporate legal form. Furthermore, the results suggest that better access to external equity investments, loosening business capital constraints, leads to better growth prospects for small C corporations. These empirical results have important macro-economic implications on corporate financial and fiscal policies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The dissolution of metal salts in silicate solution can result in the growth of hollow precipitate tubes. These \"chemical gardens\" are a model of self organization far from the equilibrium and create permanent macroscopic structures. The reproducibility of the growth process is greatly improved if the solid salt seed is replaced by a salt solution that is steadily injected by a pump; however, this modification of the original experiment eliminates the membrane-based osmotic pump at the base of conventional chemical gardens and does not allow for analyses in terms of the involved pressure. Here we describe a new experimental method that delivers the salt solution according to a controlled hydrostatic pressure. In one form of the experiment, this pressure slowly decreases as zinc sulfate solution flows into the silicate-containing reaction vessel, whereas a second version holds the respective solution heights constant. In addition to three known growth regimes (jetting, popping, budding), we observe single tubes that fill the vessel in a horizontally undulating but vertically layered fashion (crowding). The resulting, dried product has a cylindrical shape, very low density, and one continuous connection from top to bottom. We also present phase diagrams of these growth modes and show that the flow characteristics of our experiments follow a reaction-independent Hagen Poiseuille equation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We report a one-phase aqueous growth of fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with tunable emission in the visible spectrum, using a ligand scaffold that is made of poly(ethylene glycol) segment appended with a metal coordinating lipoic acid at one end and a functional group at the other end. This synthetic scheme exploits the ability of the UV-induced photochemical transformation of LA-based ligands to provide DHLA and other thiol byproducts that exhibit great affinity to metal nanoparticles, obviating the need for chemical reduction of the dithiolane ring using classical reducing agents. The influence of various experimental conditions, including the photoirradiation time, gold precursor-to-ligand molar ratios, time of reaction, temperature, and the medium pH, on the growth of AuNCs has been systematically investigated. The photophysical properties, size, and structural characterization were carried out using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, TEM, DOSY-NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The hydrodynamic size (R-H) obtained by DOSY-NMR indicates that the size of these clusters follows the trend anticipated from the absorption and PL data, with R-H(red) > R-H(yellow) > R-H(blue). The tunable emission and size of these gold nanoclusters combined with their high biocompatibility would make them greatly promising for potential use in imaging and sensing applications.",

Single crystal X-ray diffraction showed the macrocyclic ligand adopting a bowl-like structure with the exo-coordinated Ru(II) centers separated by 7.29 angstrom. Photophysical characterization showed that the complex absorbs in the visible region (lambda(max) = 451 nm) with an emission maximum at 610 nm (tau = 706 ns, Phi(PL) = 0.021). Electrochemical studies indicate the di-Ru complex undergoes three one -electron reversible reductions and a reversible one-electron oxidation process. This electrochemical reversibility is a key characteristic for its use as an electron transfer agents. The complex was evaluated as a photocatalyst for the electronically mismatched Diets-Alder reaction of isoprene and trans-anethote using visible light. It afforded the expected product in good conversion (69%) and selectivity (dr > 10 :1) at low loadings (0.5-5.0 mol%) and the sensitizer/catalyst was readily recycled. These results suggest that the bipyridyl macrocycle could be widely applied as a bridging ligand for the generation of chromophore-catalyst assemblies.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Reactions of Fe(II) precursors with the tetradentate ligand S,S'-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,2-thioethane (bpte) and monodentate NCE- coligands afforded mononuclear complexes [Fe(bpte)(NCE)(2)] (1, E = S; 2, E = Se; 3, E = BH3) that exhibit temperature-induced spin crossover (SCO). As the ligand field strength increases from NCS- to NCSe- to NCBH3-, the SCO shifts to higher temperatures. Complex 1 exhibits only a partial (15%) conversion from the high-spin (HS) to the low-spin (LS) state, with an onset around 100 K. Complex 3 exhibits a complete SCO with T-1/2, = 243 K While the gamma-2 polymorph also shows the complete SCO with T-1/2 = 192 K, the alpha-2 polymorph exhibits a two-step SCO with the first step leading to a 50% HS -> LS conversion with T-1/2 = 120 K and the second step proceeding incompletely in the 80-50 K range. The amount of residual HS fraction of alpha-2 that remains below 60 K depends on the cooling rate. Fast flash-cooling allows trapping of as much as 45% of the HS fraction, while slow cooling leads to a 14% residual HS fraction. The slowly cooled sample of alpha-2 was subjected to irradiation in the magnetometer cavity resulting in a light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) effect. As demonstrated by Mossbauer spectroscopy, an HS fraction of up to 85% could be achieved by irradiation at 4.2 K",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study optimizes numerically the relative sizes, spacings (internal structure), and aspect ratios (external configuration) of a single alkaline membrane fuel cell for maximum net power. The alkaline membrane fuel cell (AMFC) cellulosic membrane brings new light to the possibility of having alkaline fuel cells that are nontoxic and asbestos free as compared with static electrolyte cells that use an asbestos separator and ammonium-based alkaline anion-exchange membranes. A dimensionless dynamic mathematical model is utilized in the process, and the results are presented in normalized charts for generality. Two degrees of freedom are considered as follows: (i) the relative thicknesses of two reaction and diffusion layers and the membrane space (internal structure); and (ii) the external aspect ratios of a square section plate that contains all single alkaline membrane fuel cell components (external configuration). The optimized internal and external configurations result from the optimal balance between electrical power output and pumping power to supply fuel and oxidant to the AMFC. A third level of optimization is found, that is, the KOH mass fraction in the electrolyte that leads to a 3-way-maximized net power output. A sixfold variation in AMFC net power output is observed as the internal and external configurations, and KOH mass fraction are changed. Such effect stresses the importance of pinpointing the optimal AMFC configuration in order to avoid poor performance. New algebraic correlations are derived to indicate in dimensionless form, the optimal configurations for the internal and external structure, and resulting maximum net power output, which are important for scaling up and down the AMFC design with ease, without having to perform new simulations.

      "Abstract Note" : "The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond nanosecond local and microsecond millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.",

      "Abstract Note" : "For the first time, we demonstrate chromate (Cr(VI)) bioreduction using methane (CH4) as the sole electron donor in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR). The experiments were divided into five stages lasting a total of 90 days, and each stage achieved a steady state for at least 15 days. Due to continued acclimation of the microbial community, the Cr(VI)-reducing capacity of the biofilm kept increasing. Cr(VI) removal at the end of the 90-day test reached 95% at an influent Cr(VI) concentration of 3 mg Cr/L and a surface loading of 0.37g of Cr m(-2) day(-1). Meiothermus (Deinococci), a potential Cr(VI)-reducing bacterium, was negligible in the inoculum but dominated the MBfR. biofilm after Cr(VI) was added to the reactor, while Methylosinus, a type II methanotrophs, represented 11%-21% of the total bacterial DNA in the biofilm. Synergy within a microbial consortia likely was responsible for Cr(VI) reduction based on CH4 oxidation. In the synergy, methanotrophs fermented CH4 to produce metabolic intermediates that were used by the Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria as electron donors. Solid Cr(III) was the main product, accounting for more than 88% of the reduced Cr in most cases. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis showed that Cr(III) accumulated inside and outside of some bacterial cells, implying that different COO -reducing mechanisms were involved.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The reaction of formohydroxamic acid [NH(OH)CHO, FHA] with Pu-III should result in stabilization of the trivalent oxidation state. However, slow oxidation to Pu-IV occurs, which leads to formation of the dimeric plutonium(IV) formohydroxamate complex Pu-2(FHA)(8). In addition to being reductants, hydroxamates are also strong pi-donor ligands. Here we show that formation of the Pu2(FHA)8 dimer occurs via covalency between the 5f orbitals on plutonium and the pi* orbitals of FHA-anions, which gives rise to a broad and intense ligand-to-metal charge-transfer feature. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations corroborate this assignment.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Square-planar high-spin Fe(II) molecular compounds are rare, and until recently, the only four examples of nonmacrocyclic or sterically driven molecular compounds of this kind shared a common FeO4 core. The trianionic pincer-type ligand [CF3-ONO]H-3 (1) supports the high-spin square-planar Fe(II) complex {[CF3-ONO]FeCl}{Li(Sv)(2)}(2) (2). In the solid state, 2 forms the dimer complex {[CF3-ONO]Fe}(2){(mu-Cl)(2)(mu-LiTHF)(4)} (3) in 96% yield by simply applying a vacuum or stirring it with pentane for 2 h. A detailed high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance and field-dependent Fe-57 Mossbauer investigation of 3 revealed a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the local iron spins which exhibit a zero-field splitting tensor characterized by negative D parameter. In solution, 2 is in equilibrium with the solvento complex {[CF3-ONO]FeCl(THF)}-{Li-2(Sv)(4)} (2 center dot Sv) and the dimer 3. A combination of frozen solution Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray crystallography helped elucidate the solvent dependent equilibrium between these three species. The oxidation chemistry of 2 center dot Sv was investigated. Complex 2 reacts readily with the one-electron oxidizing agent CuCl2 to give the Fe(III) complex {[CF3-ONO]FeCl2}{Li(THF)(2)}(2) (4). Also, 2 center dot Sv reacts with 2 equiv of TlPF6 to form the Fe(III) complex [CF3-ONO]Fe(THF)(3) (5).",

      "Abstract Note" : "Complete duplication of large metazoan chromosomes requires thousands of potential initiation sites, only a small fraction of which are selected in each cell cycle. Assembly of the replication machinery is highly conserved and tightly regulated during the cell cycle, but the sites of initiation are highly flexible, and their temporal order of firing is regulated at the level of large-scale multi-replicon domains. Importantly, the number of replication forks must be quickly adjusted in response to replication stress to prevent genome instability. Here we argue that large genomes are divided into domains for exactly this reason. Once established, domain structure abrogates the need for precise initiation sites and creates a scaffold for the evolution of other chromosome functions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "1. Habitat use studies can be used to investigate ecological and behavioural patterns of animals and serve as useful tools for conservation planners. However, specific habitats essential to survival can be difficult to determine for highly mobile marine animals, especially when these species are rare or endangered. 2. Active acoustic tracking telemetry was used to determine daily activity spaces and rates of movement of juvenile smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) in critical habitat areas of south-west Florida, USA. 3. Activity space size and rates of movement were positively related with the size of the area where the animal was tracked. Overall, activity spaces were small and ranged from 0.07-0.17 km(2) using 95% minimum convex polygons, 0.01-0.16 km(2) based on 50% kernel density estimates (KDE), and 0.08-0.68 km(2) based on 95% KDE. Rates of movement ranged from 2.4 to 6.1 m min(-1). 4. There were no detectable differences in activity space or rates of movement between ebb and flood tide or high or low tide. Activity space decreased and rates of movement increased at night, possibly related to nocturnal foraging behaviour or predator avoidance. Comparisons of tracked animal locations and random locations suggested there was selection for those habitats in close proximity to mangrove shoreline. 5. Though daily activity spaces were small, juvenile smalltooth sawfish did exhibit a daily expansion in activity space over the monitoring period. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

We examine how structurational conditions (i.e. routinization and reflexivity), information technology (IT) embeddedness, IT enactment (i.e. task coordination and relationship management) and sense-making together impact relationship quality. Findings support the central contention that agents' cognitive efforts were necessary mediating conditions to realize the benefits of IT embeddedness and structurational conditions in relationship quality enhancement. Also interesting is while IT enactment and sense-making both positively contribute to a trusting, committed and stable relationship, greater ability in making sense of everyday interactions appears to mitigate the effect of IT enactment on relationship quality.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background: Electronic health records (EHR) with computerized physician order entry have become exceedingly common and government incentives have urged implementation. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of EHR implementation on medical intensive care unit (MICU) mortality, length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and medication errors. Materials and Methods: Prospective, observational study from July 2010-June 2011 in MICU at an urban teaching hospital in Atlanta, Georgia of 797 patients admitted to the MICU; 281 patients before the EHR implementation and 516 patients post-EHR implementation. Results: Compared with the preimplementation period (N = 43 per 281), the mortality risk at 4 months post-EHR implementation (N = 41 per 247) and at 8 months post-EHR implementation (N = 26 per 269) significantly decreased (P < 0.001). In addition, the mean MICU LOS statistically decreased from 4.03 +/- 1.06 days pre-EHR to 3.26 +/- 1.06 days 4 months post-EHR and to 3.12 +/- 1.05 days 8 months post-EHR (P = 0.002). However, the mean hospital LOS was not statistically decreased. Although medication errors increased after implementation (P = 0.002), this was attributable to less severe errors and there was actually a decrease in the number of severe medication errors (both P < 0.001). Conclusions: We report a survival benefit following the implementation of EHR with computerized physician order entry in a critical care setting and a concomitant decrease in the number of severe medication errors. Although overall hospital LOS was not shortened, this study proposes that EHR implementation in a busy urban hospital was associated with improved ICU outcomes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Discussions of geography's role outside the academy have tended toward arguments for greater public relevance, either by revising the discipline's empirical foci, or by adopting more public-oriented or activist approaches to research. While we are sympathetic to these ideas, we see an inherent tension between the discursive goals of academic scholarship and the everyday political world beyond it. Political discourse makes productive use of signifiers for which multiple meanings already exist, and gains power by exploiting their ambiguity. Academic discourse, on the other hand, seeks to clarify meanings through definitions and carefully delimited empirics in order to elucidate new ideas. We argue that the recognition and appreciation of these divergent discursive goals can serve efforts to make geographic scholarship more widely relevant if scholars make academic contributions iteratively parallel to political ones, rather than attempting to blend the two as a simultaneous practice. Scholarship that works to produce and utilise analytical terms of art within scholarly discourses to more accurately describe political processes can enable new critiques and the imagination of new political possibilities that are difficult to conceptualise from within everyday political discourses. The most strategic way for a scholar to make a political intervention, however, is to frame the suggestion within existing political discourses. Therefore, contributions in each discourse serve specific, unique purposes. The two discourses can also usefully play off of each other. When new political practices arise in the everyday political realm, new research projects can usefully evaluate their impacts to inform further suggestions for political interventions. We elucidate these ideas in three principles to guide an academic praxis of iterative parallelism for scholars interested in making political impacts alongside their scholarship.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Coordinatively unsaturated Fe-III metal sites were successfully incorporated into the iconic MOF-5 framework. This new structure, Fe-III-iMOF-5, is the first example of an interpenetrated MOF linked through intercalated metal ions. Structural characterization was performed with single-crystal and powder XRD, followed by extensive analysis by spectroscopic methods and solid-state NMR, which reveals the paramagnetic ion through its interaction with the framework. EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopy confirmed that the intercalated ions were indeed FeIII, whereas DFT calculations were employed to ascertain the unique pentacoordinate architecture around the FeIII ion. Interestingly, this is also the first crystallographic evidence of pentacoordinate ZnII within the MOF-5 SBU. This new MOF structure displays the potential for metal-site addition as a framework connector, thus creating further opportunity for the innovative development of new MOF materials.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This analysis studies how variation in individuals' motivation to form accurate judgments affects the process of political discussion. I use a small-group experiment in which participants compete to elect the simulated candidate who best represents their true preferences. I manipulate economic incentives to control participants' accuracy motivations. The results show that accuracy-motivated participants, compared to those with weaker accuracy goals, seek discussants with more expertise and a more diverse set of viewpoints, place greater emphasis on socially provided messages, and reduce emphasis on political predispositions. As a result of these differences, however, accuracy-motivated participants rely more heavily on biased information. Hence, accuracy motivations do not produce more accurate judgments or better decisions. Although previous work on political discussion has largely ignored the role of motivations, these results suggest that accuracy motivations play an important but nuanced role in this process. Strengthened accuracy motivations increase individuals' exposure to political expertise and ideological diversity but also increase their potential to be misled.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of 4-phenylcyclopentene is investigated for the first time under various conditions. Thermodynamic analysis reveals a polymerization enthalpy and entropy sufficient for high molar mass and conversions at lower temperatures. In one example, neat polymerization using Hoveyda-Grubbs second generation catalyst at -15 degrees C yields 81% conversion to poly(4-phenylcyclopentene) (P4PCP) with a number average molar mass of 151 kg mol(-1) and dispersity of 1.77. Quantitative homogeneous hydrogenation of P4PCP results in a precision ethylene-styrene copolymer (H-2-P4PCP) with a phenyl branch at every fifth carbon along the backbone. This equates to a perfectly alternating trimethylene-styrene sequence with 71.2% w/w styrene content that is inaccessible through molecular catalyst copolymerization strategies. Differential scanning calorimetry confirms P4PCP and H-2-P4PCP are amorphous materials with similar glass transition temperatures (T-g) of 17 +/- 2 degrees C. Both materials present well-defined styrenic analogs for application in specialty materials or composites where lower softening temperatures may be desired.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We examine whether the risk characterization estimated by catastrophic loss projection models is sensitive to the revelation of new information regarding risk type. We use commercial loss projection models from two widely employed modeling firms to estimate the expected hurricane losses of Florida Atlantic University's building stock, both including and excluding secondary information regarding hurricane mitigation features that influence damage vulnerability. We then compare the results of the models without and with this revealed information and find that the revelation of additional, secondary information influences modeled losses for the windstorm-exposed university building stock, primarily evidenced by meaningful percent differences in the loss exceedance output indicated after secondary modifiers are incorporated in the analysis. Secondary risk characteristics for the data set studied appear to have substantially greater impact on probable maximum loss estimates than on average annual loss estimates. While it may be intuitively expected for catastrophe models to indicate that secondary risk characteristics hold value for reducing modeled losses, the finding that the primary value of secondary risk characteristics is in reduction of losses in the tail (low probability, high severity) events is less intuitive, and therefore especially interesting. Further, we address the benefit-cost tradeoffs that commercial entities must consider when deciding whether to undergo the data collection necessary to include secondary information in modeling. Although we assert the long-term benefit-cost tradeoff is positive for virtually every entity, we acknowledge short-term disincentives to such an effort.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction regiospecifically produces 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole molecules. This heterocycle formation chemistry has high tolerance to reaction conditions and substrate structures. Therefore, it has been practiced not only within, but also far beyond the area of heterocyclic chemistry. Herein, the mechanistic understanding of CuAAC is summarized, with a particular emphasis on the significance of copper/azide interactions. Our analysis concludes that the formation of the azide/copper(I) acetylide complex in the early stage of the reaction dictates the reaction rate. The subsequent triazole ring-formation step is fast and consequently possibly kinetically invisible. Therefore, structures of substrates and copper catalysts, as well as other reaction variables that are conducive to the formation of the copper/alkyne/azide ternary complex predisposed for cycloaddition would result in highly efficient CuAAC reactions. Specifically, terminal alkynes with relatively low pK(a) values and an inclination to engage in -backbonding with copper(I), azides with ancillary copper-binding ligands (aka chelating azides), and copper catalysts that resist aggregation, balance redox activity with Lewis acidity, and allow for dinuclear cooperative catalysis are favored in CuAAC reactions. Brief discussions on the mechanistic aspects of internal alkyne-involved CuAAC reactions are also included, based on the relatively limited data that are available at this point.",

      "Abstract Note" : "At ultrahigh magnetic field strengths (B-0 >= 7.0 T), potassium (K-39) MRI might evolve into an interesting tool for biomedical research. However, K-39 MRI is still challenging because of the low NMR sensitivity and short relaxation times. In this work, we demonstrated the feasibility of K-39 MRI at 21.1 T, determined in vivo relaxation times of the rat head at 21.1 T, and compared K-39 and sodium (Na-23) relaxation times of model solutions containing different agarose gel concentrations at 7.0 and 21.1 T. K-39 relaxation times were markedly shorter than those of Na-23. Compared with the lower field strength, K-39 relaxation times were up to 1.9- (T-1), 1.4- (T-2S) and 1.9-fold (T-2L) longer at 21.1 T. The increase in the Na-23 relaxation times was less pronounced (up to 1.2-fold). Mono-exponential fits of the K-39 longitudinal relaxation time at 21.1 T revealed T-1 = 14.2 +/- 0.1 ms for the healthy rat head. The K-39 trans-verse relaxation times were 1.8 +/- 0.2 ms and 14.3 +/- 0.3 ms for the short (T-2S) and long (T-2L) components, respectively. Na-23 relaxation times were markedly longer (T-1 = 41.6 +/- 0.4 ms; T-2S = 4.9 +/- 0.2 ms; T-2L = 33.2 +/- 0.2 ms). K-39 MRI of the healthy rat head could be performed with a nominal spatial resolution of 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3) within an acquisition time of 75 min. The increase in the relaxation times with magnetic field strength is beneficial for Na-23 and K-39 MRI at ultrahigh magnetic field strength. Our results demonstrate that K-39 MRI at 21.1 T enables acceptable image quality for preclinical research. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This work reports advances in miniaturizing 3D printing to the nanometer scale using scanning probe microscopy in conjunction with local material delivery. Using polyelectrolyte polymers and complexes, we have demonstrated the concept of layer-by-layer nanoprinting by design. Nanometer precision is achieved in all three dimensions, as well as in interlayer registry. The approach enables production of designed functional 3D materials with nanometer resolution and, as such, creates a platform for conducting scientific research in designed 3D nanoenvironments as well. In doing so, it enables production of nanomaterials and scaffolds for photonics devices, biomedicine, and tissue engineering.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates are declining, racial-ethnic disparities in CRC mortality nationally are widening. Herein, the authors attempted to identify county-level variations in this pattern, and to characterize counties with improving disparity trends. METHODS: The authors examined 20-year trends in US county-level black-white disparities in CRC age-adjusted mortality rates during the study period between 1989 and 2010. Using a mixed linear model, counties were grouped into mutually exclusive patterns of black-white racial disparity trends in age-adjusted CRC mortality across 20 three-year rolling average data points. County-level characteristics from census data and from the Area Health Resources File were normalized and entered into a principal component analysis. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to test the relation between these factors (clusters of related contextual variables) and the disparity trend pattern group for each county. RESULTS: Counties were grouped into 4 disparity trend pattern groups: 1) persistent disparity (parallel black and white trend lines); 2) diverging (widening disparity); 3) sustained equality; and 4) converging (moving from disparate outcomes toward equality). The initial principal component analysis clustered the 82 independent variables into a smaller number of components, 6 of which explained 47% of the county-level variation in disparity trend patterns. CONCLUSIONS: County-level variation in social determinants, health care workforce, and health systems all were found to contribute to variations in cancer mortality disparity trend patterns from 1990 through 2010. Counties sustaining equality over time or moving from disparities to equality in cancer mortality suggest that disparities are not inevitable, and provide hope that more communities can achieve optimal and equitable cancer outcomes for all.

      "Abstract Note" : "A 1-D-2-D coupled numerical model embedded with the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on algae growth was developed to simulate the algae concentration for a river-lake system. Based on the laboratory experiment and field investigation, the flow-disturbance parameter ' was presented to improve the algae growth formula. By numerical simulation, the algae growth processes in a river-lake system were simulated, and the temporal and spatial distributions of Chl-a concentration in the area were analysed. Our results show the following: (1) Hydrodynamic conditions play an apparent effect on algae growth. A suitable turbulence is more beneficial for algal proliferation than the static or intense mixing. (2) In the studied area, the flow disturbances in the east-west rivers are generally stronger than that in the north-south rivers, while the Chl-a concentration is oppositely distributed in the river networks. (3) As a result of the different flow disturbance intensities during periods, the algae cell density in all investigated sections also alters evidently along with the seasons. The average Chl-a concentration in the dry seasons (November-April) increased by 9.22% than that in the flood seasons (May-October). (4) From the point of the whole river-lake system, the dynamic conditions in the lake inlet areas are more suitable for algae growth than that in the river networks. The Chl-a concentrations of S2 and S4 are averagely increased by 18.5% than that in the river networks. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The preparation, structures, and magnetic properties of two tricyanoferrates, [NEt4](2)[(Tp*(Me))Fe-II(CN)(3)]center dot MeCN (1) and [NEt4][(Tp*(Me))Fe-III(CN)(3)]center dot H2O (2), and three trinuclear derivatives, {[(Tp*(Me))Fe-III(CN)(3)](2)[Ni-II(L)(2)]}center dot n(solvent) (L = bpy, 3; tren, 4; DETA, 5) are described. Magnetic measurements show that 2 is an S = (1)/(2) complex [g = 2.65(1)], while 3-5 display S-T = 2 spin ground states, owing to cyanide-mediated ferromagnetic exchange between Fe-LS(III) (S = (1)/(2)) and Ni-II (S = 1) ions. The chi T vs. T data for 3-5 were modelled using an isotropic Heisenberg model and give J/k(B) and g(avg) values of +11.1(1) K and 2.48(1) for 3, 9.1(1) K and 2.6(1) for 4, and +11.2(1) K and 2.41(5) for 5 (with zJ' = -0.28 K). High-field/frequency EPR data indicates significant g-anisotropy in 2 (g(z) = 3.6, g(y) = 2.2, g(x) = 2.0) and [NEt4][(Tp*)Fe-III(CN)(3)]center dot H2O (6) (g(z) = 3.5, g(y) = 2.0, g(x) = 1.3), while 5 shows D = -2.09 cm(-1), E = 0.08 cm(-1), and B-4(0) = -2.3x10(-3) cm(-1) with g(z) = 2.4 and g(x) = g(y) = 1.95. Despite significant magnetic anisotropy in 3-5, frequency-dependent behavior is only seen for 5 above 1.8 K, suggesting that rapid quantum tunnelling of the magnetization is operative.",

The measure was translated into Japanese and its reliability, validity, and factor structure were verified. Participants comprised 286 university students (age: 19 I years). All participants were administered the scale, along with several indices of anxiety (i.e., Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Short Health Anxiety Inventory Illness Likelihood Scale, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The Japanese version of the Body Vigilance Scale exhibited a unidimensional factor structure and strong internal consistency. Construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations with the above measures.

Occupational exposure data were harvested from the O*NET Release 6.0. Results: Greater complexity was associated with better self-perceived memory among women and men, and better episodic memory and executive functioning among women. Greater physical hazards were independently associated with poorer episodic memory and executive functioning. Conclusions: Objective assessments of physical and psychosocial exposures in the workplace are independently associated with cognitive outcomes in adulthood, with psychosocial exposures being particularly pronounced among women.",

Results: Overall, 77% of participants reported receipt of mental health services during their firefighting careers (attempt history, 93%; plan but no attempt, 77%; and ideation only 68%). Firefighters with fewer years of service were less likely than those with more years to have accessed treatment. Service nonusers were more likely than service users to report concerns regarding reputation and embarrassment as barriers to care. Conclusions: Findings from this preliminary investigation suggest that the majority of firefighters with a history of elevated suicide risk have received mental health services.",

The hypotheses are tested using data from a multisite sample of African American adolescent males from the Family and Community Health Study. Results from a series of multilevel models provide evidence of both contextual and indirect effects of neighborhood culture on sexual partnering; moreover, these effects are conditioned by neighborhood structural deprivation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Background and Objectives: There is evidence that anxiety sensitivity (AS) plays a role in the maintenance of smoking, yet there is little understanding of how AS interplays with other affective symptomatology variables that are also related to smoking, such as dysphoria. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study evaluated the interactive effects of AS and dysphoria on emotion regulatory cognitions, including smoking negative affect reduction expectancies, perceived barriers for cessation, and smoking-specific experiential avoidance. Method: A total of 448 adult treatment-seeking daily smokers, who responded to study advertisements, were recruited to participate in a smoking cessation treatment trial (47.8% female; M-age = 37.2, SD = 13.5). The current study utilized self-report baseline data from trial participants. Results: After accounting for covariates, simple slope analyses revealed that AS was positively related to negative affect reduction expectancies (beta = .03, p = .01), perceived barriers to cessation (beta = .22, p = .002), and smoking avoidance and inflexibility (beta = .07, p = .04), among smokers with lower (vs. higher) levels of dysphoria. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that higher levels of dysphoria may mitigate the relation between AS and emotion regulatory cognitions of smoking. Scientific Significance: The current findings highlight the unique and additive clinical relevance of AS and dysphoria regarding emotion regulatory smoking cognitions that may impede quit success.",

We quantified the consumption of terrestrial and algal dissolved organic carbon, and the subsequent allocation of these pools to bacterial growth and respiration, based on the delta C-13 isotopic signatures of bacterial biomass and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2). Our results confirm that bacterial communities preferentially remove algal C from the terrestrially dominated organic C pool of lakes, but contrary to current assumptions, selectively allocate this autochthonous substrate to respiration, whereas terrestrial C was preferentially allocated to biosynthesis. The results provide further evidence of a mechanism whereby inputs of labile, algal-derived organic C may stimulate the incorporation of a more recalcitrant, terrestrial C pool. This mechanism resulted in a counterintuitive pattern of high and relatively constant levels of allochthony (similar to 76%) in bacterial biomass across lakes that otherwise differ greatly in productivity and external inputs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Very few genetic variants have been associated with depression and neuroticism, likely because of limitations on sample size in previous studies. Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes (vertical bar(p) over cap vertical bar approximate to 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We develop and test a model of factors that may account for how quickly interviewers make decisions about job applicants. Data were collected from 166 interviewers who interviewed applicants (N=691) at a university career centre. Results revealed that interviewers who possessed more experience and higher interviewing efficacy tended to make quicker decisions, as did interviewers who engaged in more rapport building. In contrast, use of question consistency (a key element of structured interviews) tended to increase the time interviewers took to make their decisions. Consistent with cognitive load theory, interview decision time had a curvilinear relationship with applicant order. Specifically, decision time increased as interviewers progressed through the first few applicants, but after about four applicants, decision time reached an asymptote and then began to decrease as interviewers evaluated additional applicants. These findings have implications for the design of future interview research (e.g., accounting for intra-interviewer changes in decision-making time across applicants), as well as for the use of interviews in organizations (e.g., designing interviews and interview schedules that discourage quick decisions).",

Using SAS (R) University Edition, we fit multilevel models with time nested within children. Children's initial levels of communication and teachers' frequency of strategy use when directed at the children predicted children's communicative outcomes. These results indicate that teachers' implementation of evidence-based communication strategies, when directed toward children with disabilities, and the interaction between their use of the strategies and children's initial levels of communication predict children's communicative outcomes.

      "Abstract Note" : "Family scholars have demonstrated that economic conditions influence marital quality and relationship instability. Similarly, researchers have identified low income and poverty as important risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV). Yet limited work has examined how economic factors influence the use of violence in the romantic context, particularly during young adulthood. Using the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (n = 928), the authors examined the influence of economic and career concerns as specific sources of conflict on IPV among a sample of young adults. Findings suggest that these areas of disagreement within romantic relationships are associated with IPV risk, net of traditional predictors. The implications of our findings for intervention and prevention efforts are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) is a competitive inhibitor of glucokinase (GCK), triggering its localization to the hepatocyte nucleus upon glucose deprivation. Here we establish the kinetic mechanism of GKRP action by analyzing its association with a genetically encoded, fluorescent variant of human GCK. Our results demonstrate that binding of GKRP to GCK involves two steps, formation of an initial encounter complex followed by conformational equilibration between two GKRP-GCK states. Fructose 6-phosphate, a known enhancer of GKRP action, promotes formation of the initial encounter complex via a 2.6-fold increase in k(on) and stabilizes the complex through a 60-fold decrease in k(off).",

      "Abstract Note" : "The adhesion of living eukaryotic cells to a substrate, one of the most complex problems in surface science, requires adsorption of extracellular proteins such as fibronectin. Thin films of polyelectrolyte complex made layer-by layer (polyelectrolyte multilayers or PEMUs) offer a high degree of control of surface charge and composition interconnected and essential variables for protein adhesion. Fibroblasts grown on multilayers of poly(styrenesulfonate), PSS, and poly(diallyldimethylammonium), PDADMA, with increasing thickness exhibit good adhesion until the 12th layer of polyelectrolyte has been added, whereupon there is a sudden transition to nonadhesive behavior. This sharp change is due to the migration of excess positive charge to the surface a previously unrecognized property of PEMUs. Precise radiotracer assays of adsorbed I-125-albumin show how protein adsorption is related to multilayer surface charge. With more negative surface charge density from the sulfonates of PSS, more albumin adsorbs to the surface. However, a loosely held or \"soft corona\" exchanges with serum protein under the Vroman effect, which is correlated with poor cell adhesion. A comprehensive view of cell adhesion highlights the central role of robust protein adhesion, which is required before any secondary effects of matrix stiffness on cell fate can come into play.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the variation across individuals(1). Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample(1,2) of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Cerebral organoids, three-dimensional cultures that model organogenesis, provide a new platform to investigatehuman brain development. High cost, variability, and tissue heterogeneity limit their broad applications. Here, we developed a miniaturized spinning bioreactor (Spin Omega) to generate forebrain-specific organoids from human iPSCs. These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical development, including progenitor zone organization, neurogenesis, gene expression, and, notably, a distinct human-specific outer radial glia cell layer. We also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Finally, we employed the forebrain organoid platform to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative analyses revealed preferential, productive infection of neural progenitors with either African or Asian ZIKV strains. ZIKV infection leads to increased cell death and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased neuronal cell-layer volume resembling microcephaly. Together, our brain-region-specific organoids and Spin Omega provide an accessible and versatile platform for modeling human brain development and disease and for compound testing, including potential ZIKV antiviral drugs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The olfactory systemis intricately linked with the endocrine system where it may serve as a detector of the internal metabolic state or energy homeostasis in addition to its classical function as a sensor of external olfactory information. The recent development of transgenic mGLU-yellow fluorescent protein mice that express a genetic reporter under the control of the preproglucagon reporter suggested the presence of the gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), in deep short axon cells (Cajal cells) of the olfactory bulb and its neuromodulatory effect on mitral cell (MC) first-order neurons. A MC target for the peptide was determined using GLP-1 receptor binding assays, immunocytochemistry for the receptor and injection of fluorescence-labelled GLP-1 analogue exendin-4. Using patch clamp recording of olfactory bulb slices in the whole-cell configuration, we report that GLP-1 and its stable analogue exendin-4 increase the action potential firing frequency of MCs by decreasing the interburst interval rather than modifying the action potential shape, train length or interspike interval. GLP-1 decreases Kv1.3 channel contribution to outward currents in voltage clamp recordings as determined by pharmacological blockade of Kv1.3 or utilizing mice with Kv1.3 gene-targeted deletion as a negative control. Because fluctuations in GLP-1 concentrations monitored by the olfactory bulb can modify the firing frequency of MCs, olfactory coding could change depending upon nutritional or physiological state. As a regulator of neuronal activity, GLP-1 or its analogue may comprise a new metabolic factor with a potential therapeutic target in the olfactory bulb (i.e. via intranasal delivery) for controlling an imbalance in energy homeostasis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) decreases caloric intake in both human patients and rodent models. In long-term intake tests, rats decrease their preference for fat and/or sugar after RYGB, and patients may have similar changes in food selection. Here we evaluated the impact of RYGB on intake during a \"cafeteria\"-style presentation of foods to assess if rats would lower the percentage of calories taken from fat and/or sugar after RYGB in a more complex dietary context. Male Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent either RYGB or sham surgery (Sham) were presurgically and postsurgically given 8-days free access to four semisolid foods representative of different fat and sugar levels along with standard chow and water. Compared with Sham rats, RYGB rats took proportionally fewer calories from fat and more calories from carbohydrates; the latter was not attributable to an increase in sugar intake. The proportion of calories taken from protein after RYGB also increased slightly. Importantly, these postsurgical macronutrient caloric intake changes in the RYGB rats were progressive, making it unlikely that the surgery had an immediate impact on the hedonic evaluation of the foods and strongly suggesting that learning is influencing the food choices. Indeed, despite these dietary shifts, RYGB, as well as Sham, rats continued to select the majority of their calories from the high-fat/high-sugar option. Apparently after RYGB, rats can progressively regulate their intake and selection of complex foods to achieve a seemingly healthier macronutrient dietary composition.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We report photoisomerization and photoaddition quantum yields in ethanol starting from each 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene, DPB, isomer. Despite the fact that the trans,trans isomer, tt-DPB, has a significant fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime, whereas no fluorescence is observed from the cis isomers, ether formation occurs with similar efficiency from tt-DPB and ct-DPB and less efficiently from cc-DPB. Photoaddition is about 72 times slower than photoisomerization to the ct- and tt-DPB isomers starting from tt- and ct-DPB, respectively. The results are consistent with addition of alcohol to the common zwitterionic trans-phenallyl cation/benzyl anion intermediate that leads to photoisomerization through a conical intersection. Ether formation from cc-DPB tracks inefficient formation of tt-DPB indicating that the small bicycle pedal cc-DPB -> tt-DPB component proceeds stepwise through the same zwitterionic trans-phenallyl cation/benzyl anion intermediate. Previous results concerning the addition of methanol to the stilbenes are similarly interpreted. In contrast to transstilbene, the fluorescence and photoisomerization quantum yields of tt-DPB are inconsistent with the assumption of strict complementarity between radiative and torsional relaxation channels of tt-DPB in alcohols.",

Two meat samples (cooked at 100 C for 30 min and autoclaved at 133 C for 20 min) of bovine brain in beef and two feed samples (bovine brain meal in beef meal and in soybean meal) were prepared at levels of 0.0008, 0.0031, 0.0063, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6%. An anti-MBP monoclonal antibody (mAb3E3) was produced using the hybridoma technique and characterized using Western blot. The optimized icELISA was CNT-specific without cross reactivity with either meat (beef and pork) or soybean meal samples and had low intra-assay (%CV <= 3.5) and interassay variability (%CV <= 3.3), with low detection limits for bovine MBP (6.4 ppb) and bovine CNT spiked in both meat (0.05%) and feed (0.0125%) samples. This assay is therefore suitable for the quantitative detection of trace amounts of contaminated animal CNT in processed food and feed products.",

We therefore sought to develop a panel of porcine blood-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for use as probes in immunoassays for the detection of PBFIs. Ten selected mAbs were identified that react with either a 60 or 90 kDa protein in the plasma fraction or a 12 kna protein in the red blood cell fraction of porcine blood. Western blot analysis of commercially produced PBFIs revealed that these antigenic proteins are not affected by various manufacturing processes. The utility of these mAbs was demonstrated in a prototype sandwich ELISA developed for this study using mAbs 19C5-E10 and 16F9-C11. The new assay is porcine blood-specific and capable of detecting <0.03% (v/v) of PBFIs in cooked (100 degrees C for 15 min) ground meats or fish.",

A recent report of supposed carbyne shows gold clusters in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. In order to determine the effects of such clusters, we performed ab initio calculations of uncapped and capped linear carbon chains and their complexes with gold clusters. The results indicate that gold dramatically alters the electron densities of the C equivalent to C bonds. The resulting charge-stabilization of the carbon chains leads to pseudocarbynes. These findings are corroborated in calculations of the structures of crystals containing isolated carbon chains and those intercalated with gold clusters. Calculated Raman spectra of these pseudocarbynes with gold clusters are in better agreement with experiment than calculated spectra of isolated carbon chains. The current work opens the way toward the design and development of a new class of metal-intercalated carbon compounds.",

The direct target cells of ZIKV in the developing human fetus are not clear. Here we show that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell-cycle-related pathways. Our results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, we establish a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The performance of flexible and stretchable sensors relies on the optimization of both the flexible substrate and the sensing element, and their synergistic interactions. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for cost-effective and scalable manufacturing of a new class of porous materials as 3D flexible and stretchable piezoresistive sensors, by assembling carbon nanotubes onto porous substrates of tunable Poisson ratios. It is shown that the piezoresistive sensitivity of the sensors increases as the substrate's Poisson's ratio decreases. Substrates with negative Poisson ratios (auxetic foams) exhibit significantly higher piezoresistive sensitivity, resulting from the coherent mode of deformation of the auxetic foam and enhanced changes of tunneling resistance of the carbon nanotube networks. Compared with conventional foam sensors, the auxetic foam sensor (AFS) with a Poisson's ratio of -0.5 demonstrates a 300% improvement in piezoresistive sensitivity and the gauge factor increases as much as 500%. The AFS has high sensing capability, is extremely robust, and capable of multimodal sensing, such as large deformation sensing, pressure sensing, shear/torsion sensing, and underwater sensing. AFS shows great potential for a broad range of wearable and portable devices applications, which are described by reporting on a series of demonstrations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The reaction of Ce-III or Pu-III with 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid (PDAH(2)) results in the formation of new f-element coordination complexes. In the case of cerium, Ce(PDA)(H2O)(2)Cl center dot H2O (1) or [Ce(PDAH)(PDA)](2)[Ce(PDAH)(PDA)] (2) was isolated depending on the Ce/ligand ratio in the reaction. The structure of 2 is composed of two distinct substructures that are constructed from the same monomer. This monomer is composed of a CeIII cation bound by one PDA(2-) dianionic ligand and one PDAH monoanionic ligand, both of which are tetradentate. Bridging by the carboxylate moieties leads to either [Ce(PDAH)(PDA)](2) dimers or [Ce(PDAH)(PDA)](1 infinity) helical chains. For plutonium, Pu(PDA)(2) (3) was the only product isolated regardless of the Pu/ligand ratio employed in the reaction. During the reaction of plutonium with PDAH(2), Pu-III is oxidized to Pu-IV, generating 3. This assignment is consistent with structural metrics and the optical absorption spectrum. Ambiguity in the assignment of the oxidation state of cerium in 1 and 2 from UV-vis-near-IR spectra invoked the use of Ce L-3,L-2-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. These experiments support the assignment of Ce-III in both compounds. The bond distances and coordination numbers are also consistent with these assignments. 3 contains 8-coordinate Pu-IV, whereas the cerium centers in 1 and 2 are 9- and/or 10-coordinate, which correlates with the increased size of Ce-III versus Pu-IV. Taken together, these data provide an example of a system where the differences in the redox behavior between these f elements creates more complex chemistry with cerium than with plutonium.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Animal development is the product of distinct components and interactions-genes, regulatory networks, and cells-and it exhibits emergent properties that cannot be inferred from the components in isolation. Often the focus is on the genotype-to-phenotype map, overlooking the process of development that turns one into the other. We propose a move toward micro-evolutionary analysis of development, incorporating new tools that enable cell type resolution and single-cell microscopy. Using the sex determination pathway in Drosophila to illustrate potential avenues of research, we highlight some of the questions that these emerging technologies can address. For example, they provide an unprecedented opportunity to study heterogeneity within cell populations, and the potential to add the dimension of time to gene regulatory network analysis. Challenges still remain in developing methods to analyze this data and to increase the throughput. However this line of research has the potential to bridge the gaps between previously more disparate fields, such as population genetics and development, opening up new avenues of research.",

The present study sought to determine how the associated features and undue influence of weight/shape on selfevaluation contribute to evidence of a clinically significant eating disorder. Method: Secondary analyses were conducted on data (N = 80; 76.3% women, 76.3% Caucasian, ages 18-43) collected through an epidemiological study of eating patterns. Descriptive statistics were used to report the sample prevalence of the features, independently and in combination. Correlations and alpha reliability were employed to examine relationships among associated features, distress regarding bingeing, and clinical diagnosis. Regression models and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the utility of the features for explaining variance in distress. Results: Internal consistency reliability for indicators was low, and several features demonstrated low or nonsignificant associations with distress and diagnosis. Feeling disgusted/depressed/guilty was the only unique predictor of distress (p = 0.001). For the ROC curves, three features was the best threshold for predicting distress. Discussion: Results support the need to refine the features to ensure better detection of clinically significant eating pathology for research inclusion and treatment of the illness.

The new data confirm that alkali feldspars exhibit extreme elastic anisotropy, so the bounds of their isotropic average properties span a wide range. The measured adiabatic moduli are, for Or(83)Ab(15) and Or(93)Ab(7), respectively, K-Reuss = 54.7(7), 54.5(5) GPa; K-Voigt = 62.9(1.1), 64.4(0.6) GPa; G(Reuss) = 24.1(1), 24.5(1) GPa; and G(Voigt) = 36.1(5), 36.1(7) GPa. The small differences in moduli between the samples suggests that variations in composition and in state of Al, Si order only have minor effects on the average elastic properties of K-rich feldspars. The new measurements confirm that the earliest determinations of elastic wave velocities of alkali feldspars, widely used to calculate wave velocities in rocks, resulted in velocities systematically and significantly too slow by 10% or more.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Herein, a method to calculate the total sulfur concentration in petroleum samples from the chemometric modeling of data obtained by positive-ion atmospheric pressure photoionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry [(+) APPI FT-ICR MS] is described. Analysis by FT-ICR MS provides both a measurement of the total sulfur concentration and detailed molecular-level speciation of sulfur-containing compounds. A total of 30 crude oil samples ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 wt % sulfur were employed to train the sulfur prediction model. The ratios of the percent relative abundance (% RA) between the sulfur classes (S-x) and the hydrocarbon (HC) class were employed as variables for principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA results reveal a highly linear trend along the principal component with the highest explained variance (PC1). Analysis of the loadings plot reveals that the S-1/HC ratio governs the trend in PC1. Values for PC2 are governed by S-1/HC, S-2/HC, and S-3/HC ratios and provide the ability to distinguish between oils with higher total sulfur contents (greater relative abundance of S-2- and S-3-containing compounds for sulfur of >1 wt %). Thus, these results indicate that the sulfur concentration of crude oils can be modeled by a linear combination of variables based on S-x/HC ratio(s). The model successfully predicted sulfur concentrations for 11 test samples within 0.36% standard deviation, as compared to sulfur concentrations obtained from bulk elemental analysis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Northwest Africa (NWA) 7533 is a Martian regolith breccia. This meteorite (and its pairings) offers a good opportunity to study (near-) surface processes that occurred on early Mars. Here, we have conducted a transmission electron microscope study of medium- and coarse-grained (a few tens to hundreds of micrometers) Ca-rich pyroxene clasts in order to define their thermal and shock histories. The pyroxene grains have a high-temperature (magmatic) origin as revealed by the well-developed pigeonite-augite exsolution microstructure. Exsolution lamella characteristics (composition, thickness, and spacing) indicate a moderately slow cooling. Some of the pyroxene clasts display evidence for local decomposition into magnetite and silica at the submicron scale. This phase decomposition may have occurred at high temperature and occurred at high oxygen fugacity at least 2-3 log units above the QFM buffer, after the formation of the exsolution lamellae. This corresponds to oxidizing conditions well above typical Martian magmatic conditions. These oxidizing conditions seem to have prevailed early and throughout most of the history of NWA 7533. The shock microstructure consists of (100) mechanical twins which have accommodated plastic deformation. Other pyroxene shock indicators are absent. Compared with SNC meteorites that all suffered significant shock metamorphism, NWA 7533 appears only mildly shocked. The twin microstructure is similar from one clast to another, suggesting that the impact which generated the (100) twins involved the compacted breccia and that the pyroxene clasts were unshocked when they were incorporated into the NWA 7533 breccia.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Granulins (Grns) are a family of small, cysteine-rich proteins that are generated upon proteolytic cleavage of their precursor, progranulin (Pgrn). All seven Grns (A-G) contain 12 conserved cysteines that form 6 intramolecular disulfide bonds, rendering this family of proteins unique. Grns are known to play multi-functional roles, including wound healing, embryonic growth, and inflammation and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their manifold functions, there exists a dearth of information regarding their structure-function relationship. Here, we sought to establish the role of disulfide bonds in promoting structure by investigating the fully reduced GrnB (rGrnB). We report that monomeric rGrnB is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) at low concentrations. rGrnB undergoes dimerization at higher concentrations to form a fuzzy complex without a net gain in the structure-a behavior increasingly identified as a hallmark of some IDPs. Interestingly, we show that rGrnB is also able to activate NF-kappa B in human neuroblastoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This activation correlates with the observed monomer-dimer dynamics. Collectively, the presented data establish that the intrinsic disorder of rGrnB governs conformational dynamics within the reduced form of the protein, and suggest that the overall structure of Grns could be entirely dictated by disulfide bonds.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Study design: Randomized crossover. Objectives: To analyze the acute effects of isolated and simultaneous application of whole-body vibration (WBV) and electromyostimulation (ES) on popliteal artery blood velocity (BV) and skin temperature (ST) of the calf in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: Valladolid, Spain. Methods: Ten subjects with SCI were assessed in five different sessions. After a familiarization session, four interventions were applied in random order; WBV, ES, simultaneous WBV and ES (WBV+ES), and 30 s of WBV followed by 30 s of ES (WBV30/ES30). Each intervention consisted of 10 sets x 1min ON+1 min OFF. Subjects were seated on their own wheelchairs with their feet on the vibration platform (10 Hz, 5mm peak-to-peak), and ES was applied on the gastrocnemius muscle of both legs (8 Hz, 400 mu s). Results: The simultaneous application (WBV+ES) produced the greatest increase in mean BV (MBV; 36% and 42%, respectively) and peak BV (PBV; 30% and 36%, respectively) during the intervention. This intervention produced the greatest mean increases in MBV (21%) and PBV (19%) during the recovery period. Last, this intervention produced the highest increase in ST during the intervention (2.1 degrees C). Conclusion: The simultaneous application of WBV+ES seems to produce a greater increase in MBV and PBV of the popliteal artery and ST of the calf than the isolated (WBV or ES) or consecutive application of both stimuli (WBV30/ES30). This study provides an efficient therapeutic methodology to improve peripheral arterial properties, which is pivotal in SCI patient's rehabilitation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BackgroundTo examine whether ethnicity moderates the association between caregiver characteristics and perceptions of childhood weight and whether these perceptions are associated with their child's obesity status. MethodsCaregivers recruited from paediatricians' offices (n=453) completed a survey about childhood health; nurses weighed and measured the children. Caregivers reported their own weight and height, demographic information about their family and made ratings of healthy weight for children in general and for their own child in particular. ResultsAfrican American caregivers were more likely to view heavier girls as healthier, but this association held only for lower income families or caregivers with higher body mass index. Hispanic caregivers were more likely to misperceive their own child's weight if either the caregiver or the child had a higher body mass index. Parents who perceived heavier weight as healthier or misperceived their own child's weight were more likely to have a child with obesity. This latter association held regardless of ethnicity. ConclusionThe association between ethnicity and perceptions of healthy childhood weight are complex. The relation between caregivers' perceptions of healthy weight and their own child's obesity status, however, was similar regardless of ethnicity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BackgroundSubstantial development in social communication skills occurs in the first two years of life. Growth should be evident in sharing emotion and eye gaze; rate of communication, communicating for a variety of functions; using gestures, sounds and words; understanding language, and using functional and pretend actions with objects in play. A delay in these early social communication skills may be the first sign of a developmental delay in young children in nearly all categories of disabilitiesincluding specific language impairment, autism spectrum disorder, HIV/AIDS, lack of environmental stimulation or institutionalization, and global developmental delaysand early detection of these delays is critical for enrolment in appropriate early intervention services. AimsNo standardized tests of early social communication skills exist for very young children in South Africa (SA). An existing evaluation tool that has the potential to be culturally fair for children from cultural backgrounds different to the standardization group is the Communication and Symbolic Behaviour ScalesDevelopmental Profile (CSBS DP). This study aimed to document the performance of a group of English-speaking SA children ranging in age from 12 to 24 months on the CSBS DP and to compare this performance with the original standardization sample. Methods & ProceduresSixty-seven English-speaking SA children from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds were assessed on the CSBS DP Behaviour Sample. Group scores were compared with the original standardization sample using inferential statistics. Outcomes & ResultsThe results provide preliminary support for the suitability and validity of the face-to-face Behaviour Sample as a measure of early social communication skills in this sample of English-speaking SA children from a range of cultural groups between 12 and 24 months of age. Conclusions & ImplicationsWhile further research in the SA population is needed, these findings are a first step towards validating a culturally appropriate measure for early detection of social communication delays in a sample of SA toddlers.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A method for directly patching exchange correlation (XC) potentials in materials is derived. The electron density of a system is partitioned into subsystem densities by dividing its Kohn Sham (KS) potential among the subsystems. Inside each subsystem, its projected KS potential is required to become the total system's KS potential. This requirement, together with the nearsightedness principle of electronic matters, ensures that the electronic structures inside subsystems can be good approximations to the total system's electronic structure. The nearsightedness principle also ensures that subsystem densities could be well localized in their regions, making it possible to use high-level methods to invert the XC potentials for subsystem densities. Two XC patching methods are developed. In the local XC patching method, the total system's XC potential is improved in the cluster region. We show that the coupling between a cluster and its environment is important for achieving a fast convergence of the electronic structure in the cluster region. In the global XC patching method, we discuss how to patch the subsystem XC potentials to construct the XC potential in the total system, aiming to scale up high-level quantum mechanics simulations of materials. Proof-of-principle examples are given.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A large-scale implementation of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method is presented. The active space is described using the variational two-electron reduced-density-matrix (v2RDM) approach and, the algorithm is applicable to much larger active spaces than can be treated using configuration-interaction-driven methods. Density fitting or Cholesky decomposition approximations to the electron repulsion integral tensor allow for the simultaneous optimization of large numbers of external orbitals. We have tested the implementation by evaluating singlet triplet energy gaps in the linear polyacene series and two dinitrene biradical compounds. For the acene series, we report computations that involve active spaces consisting of as many as 50 electrons in 50 Orbitals and the simultaneous optimization of 1892 orbitals. For the dinitrene compounds, we find that the singlet triplet gaps obtained from v2RDM-driven CASSCF with partial three-electron N-representability conditions agree with those obtained from configuration-interaction-driven approaches to within one-third of 1 kcal mol(-1). When enforcing only the two-electron N-representability conditions, v2RDM-driven CASSCF yields less accurate singlet-triplet energy gaps in these systems, but the quality of the results is still far superior to those obtained from standard single-reference approaches.",

We term this segment of individuals super consumers. The data came from an online survey of 351 adult US consumers. A cluster analysis using these three variables as criteria produced a two-cluster solution. Comparing mean scores between these two groups of consumers on measures of market mavenism, shopping frequency, amount of spending, age, and gender showed that the super consumers were significantly more likely to be market mavens, to shop more frequently, and to spend more than the other consumers were. The super consumers were younger in age as well, but there were no gender differences between the two groups. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Regional partnerships have grown popular as mechanisms to address public goods that transcend local boundaries, but we know little about their effectiveness. For example, what impact do regional economic development partnerships (REDPs), cooperative organizations of local governments, nonprofits and business organizations have on the economies of metropolitan areas? This article employs survival analysis and multilevel growth curve models to examine how the emergence of regional partnership arrangements influences patterns of economic development in U.S. metropolitan areas. The results suggest that, whereas these organizations do not make a great difference in some metro areas, in densely populated and politically fragmented metropolitan areas personal incomes, business firms, and employment grew significantly with the emergence of REDPs. Furthermore, state level factors, such as intergovernmental grant funding, are found to have positive influences. In conclusion, we discuss regional partnerships as solutions to institutional collective action problems in economic development and other policy arenas.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Inflammasomes are cytosolic caspase-1-activation complexes that sense intrinsic and extrinsic danger signals, and trigger inflammatory responses and pyroptotic cell death. Homotypic interactions among Pyrin domains and caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) in inflammasome-complex components mediate oligomerization into filamentous assemblies. Several cytosolic proteins consisting of only interaction domains exert inhibitory effects on inflammasome assembly. In this study, we determined the structure of the human caspase-1 CARD domain (caspase-1(CARD)) filament by cryo-electron microscopy and investigated the biophysical properties of two caspase-1-like CARD-only proteins: human inhibitor of CARD (INCA or CARD17) and ICEBERG (CARD18). Our results reveal that INCA caps caspase-1 filaments, thereby exerting potent inhibition with low-nanomolar K-i on caspase-1(CARD) polymerization in vitro and inflammasome activation in cells. Whereas caspase-1(CARD) uses six complementary surfaces of three types for filament assembly, INCA is defective in two of the six interfaces and thus terminates the caspase-1 filament.",

      "Abstract Note" : "ObjectivesThe use of geometric morphometry to study cranial variation has steadily grown in appeal over the past decade in biological anthropology. Publication trends suggest that the most popular methods for three-dimensional data acquisition involve landmark-based coordinate data collection using a digitizer. Newer laser scan approaches are seeing increasing use, owing to the benefits that densely sampled data offer. While both of these methods have their utility, research that investigates their compatibility is lacking. The purpose of this project is to compare, quantitatively, craniometrics collected with a digitizer against data extracted from laser scans using the same individuals and laboratory conditions. Materials and MethodsThree-dimensional (x,y,z) coordinates and traditional inter-landmark distances (ILDs) were obtained with a Microscribe digitizer and 360 degrees color models produced from NextEngine laser scans for 38 adult crania representing five cemeteries from the ADBOU skeletal collection in Denmark. Variance-based tests were performed to evaluate the disagreement between data collected with a digitizer and from laser scan models. Consideration was given to differences among landmarks by type, between ILDs calculated from landmark coordinates, and in morphology for the cemetery populations. Further, the reliability of laser scan data collection was assessed by intra-observer error tests. ResultsResearchers should be aware of the potential error associated with the use of Types II and III landmarks and the limitations on reliability imposed by object-to-scanner placement. DiscussionThis project reveals how laser scans can provide a valuable digital archive of cranial material that can be reasonably exploited for the virtual collection of coordinates and the calculation of ILDs.

The most common manifestation of arsenic exposure in susceptible individuals is bilateral palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. We report a 67-year-old man with no known prior exposure to arsenic in the USA or family history of PPK who developed multiple squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) and palmoplantar hyperkeratotic lesions beginning 23 years after service in Vietnam. The SCCIS were located on the trunk and extremities in both sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed sites and his palmoplantar lesions were diagnosed concurrently with his SCCIS. He has continued to develop SCCIS since his first visit to our clinic 25 years ago.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This article develops the first climatology of the low-level jet that prevails in the Turkana Channel of northern Kenya. ERA-Interim data are utilized, giving the analysis a resolution of 0.75 degrees of latitude/longitude and a temporal resolution of 6 h. The jet is found to be a semi-permanent feature, its occurrence ranging from 69% of the days in May to 90% of the days in October. It is strongest during the June-September dry season. Typical core speeds in a 0.75 x 0.75 grid point are 10-15 m s(-1). The Turkana Jet is clearly a nocturnal feature, being strongest at 0000 UTC or 0600 UTC and usually barely discernible at 1200 UTC. There are distinct patterns of divergence and vertical motion associated with the jet and these differ between the entrance, core, and exit regions. The jet appears to modulate rainfall, especially during the nocturnal hours, with strong jets suppressing rainfall. It also appears to be a factor in the prevailing aridity in the northeast Kenya, southern Somalia, and southeastern Ethiopia and the absence of a summer rainy season in this region.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parents of children who are overweight often fail to accurately identify their child's weight status. Although these misperceptions are presumed to be a major public health concern, little research has examined whether parental perceptions of child weight status are protective against weight gain during childhood. Our objective was to examine whether parental perceptions of child weight status are associated with weight gain across childhood. METHODS: Data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children were used to assess parental perceptions of child weight status and to examine changes in researcher measured child BMI z scores across childhood, from 4 to 13 years old. Participants included 3557 Australian children and their parents. RESULTS: Children whose parents perceived their weight as being \"overweight,\" as opposed to \"about the right weight,\" gained more weight (increase in BMI z score) from baseline to follow-up in all analyses. This finding did not depend on the actual weight of the child; the association between perceiving one's child as being overweight and future weight gain was similar among children whose parents accurately and inaccurately believed their child was overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to popular belief, parental identification of child overweight is not protective against further weight gain. Rather, it is associated with more weight gain across childhood. Further research is needed to understand how parental perceptions of child weight may counterintuitively contribute to obesity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A considerable amount is known about the factors that influence policy adoption and implementation across different issue areas. Less is known, however, about the factors that influence governments to abandon programs or policies prior to reaching their stated objectives or originally specified end-points. This article applies termination theory to local climate protection initiatives and examines cities' withdrawal from the dominant sustainability organization facilitating these efforts. In the face of national government inaction, large numbers of U.S. municipalities voluntarily committed to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and joined the ICLEI's Climate Protection program. After steady membership increases for nearly a decade, ICLEI attained its largest size in 2010 with 565 city members. Over the next 2 years, this number plummeted by 20 percent. Positioned in the literature on policy change, we empirically test three hypotheses for why a substantial portion of cities ended their affiliation with this organization and terminated the explicit climate protection objectives associated with it: (1) political ideology and interest group pressure, (2) fiscal constraints, and (3) perceived program ineffectiveness. Analytical results support the first and third hypotheses. We identify factors that influence the termination of local GHG reduction initiatives and discuss theoretical implications of these findings.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used as a non-invasive method to evaluate heart rate (HR) regulation by the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. In this review, we discuss the effect of resistance exercise both acutely and after training on HRV in healthy individuals and in those with diseases characterized by autonomic dysfunction, such as hypertension and fibromyalgia. HR recovery after exercise is influenced by parasympathetic reactivation and sympathetic recovery to resting levels. Therefore, examination of HRV in response to acute exercise yields valuable insight into autonomic cardiovascular modulation and possible underlying risk for disease. Acute resistance exercise has shown to decrease cardiac parasympathetic modulation more than aerobic exercise in young healthy adults suggesting an increased risk for cardiovascular dysfunction after resistance exercise. Resistance exercise training appears to have no effect on resting HRV in healthy young adults, while it may improve parasympathetic modulation in middle-aged adults with autonomic dysfunction. Acute resistance exercise appears to decrease parasympathetic activity regardless of age. This review examines the acute and chronic effects of resistance exercise on HRV in young and older adults.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are often involved in signaling and regulatory functions, through binding to cellular targets. Many IDPs undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding. Both the binding mechanisms and the magnitudes of the binding rate constants can have functional importance. Previously we have found that the coupled binding and folding of any IDP generally follows a sequential mechanism that we term dock-and-coalesce, whereby one segment of the IDP first docks to its subsite on the target surface and the remaining segments subsequently coalesce around their respective subsites. Here we applied our TransComp method within the framework of the dock-and-coalesce mechanism to dissect the binding kinetics of two Rho-family GTPases, Cdc42 and TC10, with two intrinsically disordered effectors, WASP and Pak1. TransComp calculations identified the basic regions preceding the GTPase binding domains (GBDs) of the effectors as the docking segment. For Cdc42 binding with both WASP and Pak1, the calculated docking rate constants are close to the observed overall binding rate constants, suggesting that basic-region docking is the rate-limiting step and subsequent conformational coalescence of the GBDs on the Cdc42 surface is fast. The possibility that conformational coalescence of the WASP GBD on the TC10 surface is slow warrants further experimental investigation. The account for the differences in binding rate constants among the three GTPase-effector systems and mutational effects therein yields deep physical and mechanistic insight into the binding processes. Our approach may guide the selection of mutations that lead to redesigned binding pathways. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

One method for identifying those students is through universal screening. Assessments such as oral reading fluency (ORF) and Maze reading comprehension are commonly used as screening assessments in middle grades. The current study examined ORF and Maze for evidence of bias across two subgroups known to be at increased risk for failure in reading: (a) students with learning disabilities and (b) students from low-income households. Data from 4,215 students in the sixth (n = 1,126), seventh (n = 1,361), and eighth grades (n = 1,728) were analyzed. Results indicate no significant differences in predictive validity for students from low-income households compared to students from middle and upper income households. For students with learning disabilities only 8th grade scores showed any evidence of bias compared to students without diagnosed disabilities. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

In addition, we investigated the effects of orthographic and phonological opacity in morphological processing.

These results are consistent with previous findings of adults with low literacy skills reliance on orthographic codes. Educational implications are discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The maximum cardinality subset selection problem requires finding the largest possible subset from a set of objects, such that one or more conditions are satisfied. An important extension of this problem is to extract multiple subsets, where the addition of one more object to a larger subset would always be preferred to increases in the size of one or more smaller subsets. We refer to this as the multiple subset maximum cardinality selection problem (MSMCSP). A recently published branch-and-bound algorithm solves the MSMCSP as a partitioning problem. Unfortunately, the computational requirement associated with the algorithm is often enormous, thus rendering the method infeasible from a practical standpoint. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that successively solves a series of binary integer linear programs to obtain a globally optimal solution to the MSMCSP. Computational comparisons of the methods using published similarity data for 45 food items reveal that the proposed sequential method is computationally far more efficient than the branch-and-bound approach.",

Considering its behavioral consequences, we argue that such knowledge transfer often may destabilize existing power structures in foreign acquired firms prompting conflict and power struggles, and as a result negatively affects their performance. We find support for this adverse knowledge transfer effect. Only at very high levels of N-LSKT, when acquirers are likely to extend their own capabilities and associated power structures more completely, do the performance effects improve. Further, predeal success of acquirers and post-deal functional integration amplify, while acquirers' strategic control over the acquired firm alleviates the generally negative effects of N-LSKT.

In the first scheme, the velocity in the Cahn-Hilliard equation is treated explicitly so that the Darcy equation is completely decoupled from the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the second scheme, an intermediate velocity is used in the Cahn-Hilliard equation which allows for the decoupling. We show that the first scheme preserves a discrete energy law with a time-step constraint, while the second scheme satisfies an energy law without any constraint and is unconditionally stable. Ample numerical experiments are performed to gauge the efficiency and robustness of our scheme. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Numer Methods Partial Differential Eq 32: 936-954, 2016",

      "Abstract Note" : "Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on plant-pollinator communities in mixed-conifer forest with frequent fire in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity, combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the pollinators, flowering plants, and plant-pollinator interactions. On average, a 5% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics contributes to the spatial heterogeneity (-diversity) of plant and pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought-induced floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition, lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover of plant-pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively affect the richness of plant-pollinator communities across large spatial scales.",

      "Abstract Note" : "gamma-AApeptides are a new class of antibacterial peptidomimetics that are not prone to antibiotic resistance and are highly resistant to protease degradation. It is not clear how gamma-AApeptides interact with bacterial membranes and alter lipid assembly, but such information is essential to understanding their antimicrobial activities and guiding future design of more potent and specific antimicrobial agents. Using electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, we characterized the membrane interaction and destabilizing mechanism of a lipo-cyclic-gamma-AApeptide (AA1), which has broad-spectrum antibacterial activities. The analyses revealed that AA1 binding increases the membrane permeability of POPC/POPG liposomes, which mimic negatively charged bacterial membranes. AA1 binding also inhibits membrane fluidity and reduces solvent accessibility around the lipid headgroup region. Moreover, AA1 interacts strongly with POPC/POPG liposomes, inducing significant lipid lateral-ordering and membrane thinning. In contrast, minimal membrane property changes were observed upon AA1 binding for liposomes mimicking mammalian cell membranes, which consist of neutral lipids and cholesterol. Our findings suggest that AA1 interacts and disrupts bacterial membranes through a carpet-like mechanism. The results showed that the intrinsic features of gamma-AApeptides are important for their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes selectively, the implications of which extend to developing new antibacterial biomaterials.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Centimeter-scale gold nanoparticle (Au NP) monolayer films have been fabricated using a water/organic solvent self-assembly strategy. A recently developed approach, drain to deposit, is demonstrated to be most effective in transferring the Au NP films from the water/organic solvent interface to various solid substrates while maintaining their integrity. The interparticle spacing was tuned from 1.4 to 3.1 rim using alkylamine ligands of different lengths. The ordering of the films increased with increasing ligand length. The surface plasmon resonance and the in-plane electrical conductivity of the Au NP films both exhibit an exponential dependence on the interparticle spacing. These findings show great potential in scaling up the manufacturing of high-performance optical and electronic devices based on two-dimensional metallic nanoparticle superlattices.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To make a two-dimensional Janus object, the perfluorinated anionic polyelectrolyte Nafion was adsorbed to the surface of ultrathin films of polyelectrolyte complex. Nafion changed the wetting characteristics of the polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEMU) of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) and poly(styrenesulfonate) from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. PEMUs assembled on aluminum substrates and terminated with Nafion could be released by exposure to alkali solution, producing free-floating films in the 100 nm thickness regime. Water contact angle measurements showed a strong difference in hydrophilicity between the two sides of this Janus film, which was further characterized using atomic-force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS revealed different fluorine contents on both sides of the PEMU, which could be translated to a Nafion gradient through the film. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the Nafion-containing films were much more resistant to decomposition by high salt concentration.",

The overall structural topology of ThP-1 highly resembles that of MOF-5, containing only one type of-three-dimensional channels with a window size of 11.32 angstrom x 11.32 angstrom. ThP-1 has a free void volume of 50.8%, making it one of the most porous purely inorganic actinide-based framework materials. More importantly, ThP-1 is highly stable in aqueous solutions over an extremely wide pH range from 1 to 14 and thus may find potential applications in selective ion exchange and catalysis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Nonheme iron enzymes perform diverse and important functions in biochemistry. The active form of these enzymes comprises the ferryl, oxidoiron(1V), [FeO](2+) unit. In enzymes, this unit is in the high -spin, quintet, S = 2, ground Exp State, while many synthetic model compounds exist in the spin triplet, S = 1, ground state. Recently, however, Que and co-workers reported an oxidoiron(IV) complex with a quintet ground state, [FeO(TMG(3)tren)](OTf)(2), where TMG(3)tren = 1,1, 1-ttis {2-[N2-(1,1,3,3 -tetramethylguanidino)]ethyl}amine and OTf = CF3SO3-. The trigonal geometry imposed by this ligand, as opposed to the tetragonal geometry of earlier model complexes, favors the high -spin ground state. Although [FeO(TMG(3)tren)](2+) has been earlier probed by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and Mossbauer spectroscopies, the technique of high -frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance (HEEPR) is superior for describing the electronic structure of the iron(IV) center because of its ability to establish directly the spin -Hamiltonian parameters of high -spin metal centers -with high precision. Herein we describe HFEPR studies on [FeO(TMG(3)tren)](OTf)(2) generated in situ and confirm the S = 2 ground state with the following parameters: D = +4.940(5) cm(-1), E = 0.000(5), B-4(0) = -14(1) x 10(-4) cm(-1), g(perpendicular to) = 2.006(2), and g(parallel to) = 2.03(2): Extraction of a fourth -order spin -Hamiltonian parameter is unusual for HFEPR and impossible by other techniques. These experimental results are combined with state-of-the-art computational studies along with previous structural and spectroscopic results to provide a complete, picture of the electronic structure of this biomimetic complex. Specifically, the calculations reproduce well the spin -Hamiltonian parameters of the complex, provide a satisfying geometrical picture of the S = 2 oxidoiron(IV) moiety, and demonstrate that the TMG(3)tren is as \"innocent\" ligand.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The distribution of blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise is altered with advancing age. Changes in arteriolar function that are muscle specific underlie age-induced changes in blood flow distribution. With advancing age, functional adaptations that occur in resistance arterioles from oxidative muscles differ from those that occur in glycolytic muscles. Age-related adaptations of morphology, as well as changes in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle signalling, differ in muscle of diverse fibre type. Age-induced endothelial dysfunction has been reported in most skeletal muscle arterioles; however, unique alterations in signalling contribute to the dysfunction in arterioles from oxidative muscles as compared with those from glycolytic muscles. In resistance arterioles from oxidative muscle, loss of nitric oxide signalling contributes significantly to endothelial dysfunction, whereas in resistance arterioles from glycolytic muscle, alterations in both nitric oxide and prostanoid signalling underlie endothelial dysfunction. Similarly, adaptations of the vascular smooth muscle that occur with advancing age are heterogeneous between arterioles from oxidative and glycolytic muscles. In both oxidative and glycolytic muscle, late-life exercise training reverses age-related microvascular dysfunction, and exercise training appears to be particularly effective in reversing endothelial dysfunction. Patterns of microvascular ageing that develop among muscles of diverse fibre type and function may be attributable to changing patterns of physical activity with ageing. Importantly, aerobic exercise training, initiated even at an advanced age, restores muscle blood flow distribution patterns and vascular function in old animals to those seen in their young counterparts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A subclass of recently discovered CRISPR repeat RNA in bacteria contains minimally recognizable structural features that facilitate an unknown mechanism of recognition and processing by the Cas6 family of endoribonucleases. Cocrystal structures of Cas6 from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmCas6b) bound with its repeat RNA revealed a dual site binding structure and a cleavage site conformation poised for phosphodiester bond breakage. Two non-interacting MmCas6b bind to two separate AAYAA motifs within the same repeat, one distal and one adjacent to the cleavage site. This bound structure potentially competes with a stable but non-productive RNA structure. At the cleavage site, MmCas6b supplies a base pair mimic to stabilize a short 2 base pair stem immediately upstream of the scissile phosphate. Complementary biochemical analyses support the dual-AAYAA binding model and a critical role of the protein-RNA base pair mimic. Our results reveal a previously unknown method of processing non-stem-loop CRISPR RNA by Cas6.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study assessed mothers' and fathers' perception of their child's risk of getting type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the first 2 years of their participation in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. TEDDY parents were informed of their child's increased genetic risk for T1D at study inception. Parent perception of the child's risk was assessed at 3, 6, 15, and 27 months of age. In families with no history of T1D, underestimation of the child's T1D risk was common in mothers (>38%) and more so in fathers (>50%). The analyses indicated that parental education, country of residence, family history of T1D, household crowding, ethnic minority status, and beliefs that the child's T1D risk can be reduced were factors associated with parental risk perception accuracy. Even when given extensive information about their child's T1D risk, parents often fail to accurately grasp the information provided. This is particularly true for fathers, families from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and those with no family history of T1D. It is important to develop improved tools for risk communication tailored to individual family needs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This study was based on a sample of male high school students who completed National Longitudinal Adolescent Health Surveys in 1994, 1995, and 2001. We studied these students prospectively, comparing those who later died by suicide (n=21) with those who were still living (n=10,101). We employed chi-square and analysis of variance tests for statistical significance between suicide decedents and living respondents. Results showed suicide decedents were more likely to have experienced the suicide loss of another family member, to have been expelled from school, to have engaged in more delinquent actions including fighting, and to have greater involvement with the criminal justice system. Although one might have expected suicide casualties to have exhibited a greater amount of suicidal thoughts, attempts, and higher incidences of suicidality among their friends, our analyses did not find that these factors were associated with actual suicides. Should these findings be replicated, this would point to a need to refine youth suicide risk assessments. Collecting life histories, as well as identifying patterns of delinquency and fighting, may serve as more potentially fruitful means for assessing genuine suicide risk than some traditional risk assessment methods.z",

      "Abstract Note" : "BackgroundBirth defects are responsible for a large proportion of disability and infant mortality. Exposure to a variety of pesticides have been linked to increased risk of birth defects. MethodsWe conducted a case-control study to estimate the associations between a residence-based metric of agricultural pesticide exposure and birth defects. We linked singleton live birth records for 2003 to 2005 from the North Carolina (NC) State Center for Health Statistics to data from the NC Birth Defects Monitoring Program. Included women had residence at delivery inside NC and infants with gestational ages from 20 to 44 weeks (n=304,906). Pesticide exposure was assigned using a previously constructed metric, estimating total chemical exposure (pounds of active ingredient) based on crops within 500 meters of maternal residence, specific dates of pregnancy, and chemical application dates based on the planting/harvesting dates of each crop. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for four categories of exposure (<10(th), 10-50(th), 50-90(th), and >90(th) percentiles) compared with unexposed. Models were adjusted for maternal race, age at delivery, education, marital status, and smoking status. ResultsWe observed elevated ORs for congenital heart defects and certain structural defects affecting the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and musculoskeletal systems (e.g., OR [95% confidence interval] [highest exposure vs. unexposed] for tracheal esophageal fistula/esophageal atresia=1.98 [0.69, 5.66], and OR for atrial septal defects: 1.70 [1.34, 2.14]). ConclusionOur results provide some evidence of associations between residential exposure to agricultural pesticides and several birth defects phenotypes.

      "Abstract Note" : "Although most efficacious marital enrichment programs are multisession, few studies have explored whether outcomes differ according to session attendance, particularly among minority groups with lower than average participation in prevention programs. This study therefore investigates attendance levels and long-term improvements in couple functioning among 164 couples participating in the Promoting Strong African American Families program. Structural equation models indicated session attendance predicted 2-year changes for men's reports of communication, commitment, and spousal support (marginally) but not for women's. Individual and couple characteristics that predicted attendance levels were also identified. Results highlight distinct gender differences in the effects of sustained attendance as well as characteristics that provide early identifiers for African American couples at increased risk of low program attendance.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We study the effect of communication in an experimental game where cooperation is consistent with equilibrium play. We examine two methodological questions which affect many studies of communication in games, particularly those studying the relationship between communication and cooperation in supergames. We show that making it easier for subjects to reach an agreement (by allowing more rounds of communication) does not increase cooperation with a limited message space treatment. Thus, limited message space treatments are not a good substitute for the use of chat. Making the game longer, thereby making the connection between the first period and the continuation game more obvious, also has little impact on cooperation. For both the two-and three-period versions of our game we find substantial amounts of contingent play. This implies that use of a finitely repeated game, which has a number of methodological advantages, maintains the main properties of the underlying supergame.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Graphical inference, a process refined by Buja et al., can be a useful tool for geographers as it provides a visual and spatial method to test null hypotheses. The core idea is to generate sample datasets from a null hypothesis to visually compare with the actual dataset. The comparison is performed from a line-up of graphs where a single graph of the actual data is hidden among multiple graphs of sample data. If the real data is discernible, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Here, we illustrate the utility of graphical inference using examples from climatology, biogeography, and health geography. The examples include inferences about location of the mean, change across space and time, and clustering. We show that graphical inference is a useful technique to answer a broad range of common questions in geographical datasets. This approach is needed to avoid the common pitfalls of straw man hypotheses and p-hacking as datasets become increasingly larger and more complex.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Since 1990 mortality and morbidity decline has been more extensive for some conditions prevalent in low-and middle-income countries than for others. One reason may be differences in the effectiveness of global health networks, which have proliferated in recent years. Some may be more capable than others in attracting attention to a condition, in generating funding, in developing interventions and in convincing national governments to adopt policies. This article introduces a supplement on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks. The supplement examines networks concerned with six global health problems: tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, tobacco use, alcohol harm, maternal mortality and newborn deaths. This article presents a conceptual framework delineating factors that may shape why networks crystallizemore easily surrounding some issues than others, and once formed, why some are better able than others to shape policy and public health outcomes. All supplement papers draw on this framework. The framework consists of 10 factors in three categories: (1) features of the networks and actors that comprise them, including leadership, governance arrangements, network composition and framing strategies; (2) conditions in the global policy environment, including potential allies and opponents, funding availability and global expectations concerning which issues should be prioritized; (3) and characteristics of the issue, including severity, tractability and affected groups. The article also explains the design of the project, which is grounded in comparison of networks surrounding three matched issues: TB and pneumonia, tobacco use and alcohol harm, and maternal and newborn survival. Despite similar burden and issue characteristics, there has been considerably greater policy traction for the first in each pair. The supplement articles aim to explain the role of networks in shaping these differences, and collectively represent the first comparative effort to understand the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Advocacy, policy, research and intervention efforts against childhood pneumonia have lagged behind other health issues, including malaria, measles and tuberculosis. Accelerating progress on the issue began in 2008, following decades of efforts by individuals and organizations to address the leading cause of childhood mortality and establish a global health network. This article traces the history of this network's formation and evolution to identify lessons for other global health issues. Through document review and interviews with current, former and potential network members, this case study identifies five distinct eras of activity against childhood pneumonia: a period of isolation (post WWII to 1984), the duration of WHO's Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Programme (1984-1995), Integrated Management of Childhood illness's (IMCI) early years (1995-2003), a brief period of network re-emergence (2003-2008) and recent accelerating progress (2008 on). Analysis of these eras reveals the critical importance of building a shared identity in order to form an effective network and take advantage of emerging opportunities. During the ARI era, an initial network formed around a relatively narrow shared identity focused on community-level care. The shift to IMCI led to the partial dissolution of this network, stalled progress on addressing pneumonia in communities and missed opportunities. Frustrated with lack of progress on the issue, actors began forming a network and shared identity that included a broad spectrum of those whose interests overlap with pneumonia. As the network coalesced and expanded, its members coordinated and collaborated on conducting and sharing research on severity and tractability, crafting comprehensive strategies and conducting advocacy. These network activities exerted indirect influence leading to increased attention, funding, policies and some implementation.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Global health issues vary in the amount of attention and resources they receive. One reason is that the networks of individuals and organizations that address these issues differ in their effectiveness. This article presents key findings from a research project on the emergence and effectiveness of global health networks addressing tobacco use, alcohol harm, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Although networks are only one of many factors influencing priority, they do matter, particularly for shaping the way the problem and solutions are understood, and convincing governments, international organizations and other global actors to address the issue. Their national-level effects vary by issue and are more difficult to ascertain. Networks are most likely to produce effects when (1) their members construct a compelling framing of the issue, one that includes a shared understanding of the problem, a consensus on solutions and convincing reasons to act and (2) they build a political coalition that includes individuals and organizations beyond their traditional base in the health sector, a task that demands engagement in the politics of the issue, not just its technical aspects. Maintaining a focused frame and sustaining a broad coalition are often in tension: effective networks find ways to balance the two challenges. The emergence and effectiveness of a network are shaped both by its members' decisions and by contextual factors, including historical influences (e.g. prior failed attempts to address the problem), features of the policy environment (e.g. global development goals) and characteristics of the issue the network addresses (e.g. its mortality burden). Their proliferation raises the issue of their legitimacy. Reasons to consider them legitimate include their members' expertise and the attention they bring to neglected issues. Reasons to question their legitimacy include their largely elite composition and the fragmentation they bring to global health governance.",

We present here resonant Raman experiments of single-layered WS2 and WSe2 using more than 25 laser lines. The Raman excitation profiles of both materials show unexpected differences. All Raman features of WS2 monolayers are enhanced by the first-optical excitations (with an asymmetric response for the spin-orbit related X-A and X-B excitons), whereas Raman bands of WSe2 are not enhanced at X-A/B energies. Such an intriguing phenomenon is addressed by DFT calculations and by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. These two materials are very similar. They prefer the same crystal arrangement, and their electronic structure is akin, with comparable spin-orbit coupling. However, we reveal that WS2 and WSe2 exhibit quite different exciton-phonon interactions. In this sense, we demonstrate that the interaction between X-C and X-A excitons with phonons explains the different Raman responses of WS2 and WSe2, and the absence of Raman enhancement for the WSe2 modes at X-A/B energies. These results reveal unusual exciton-phonon interactions and open new avenues for understanding the two-dimensional materials physics, where weak interactions play a key role coupling different degrees of freedom (spin, optic, and electronic).",

The present study examined whether allostatic load is associated with personality and personality changes during a 4-year follow-up. Methods: A total of 5200 participants aged from 50 to 99 years (59.5% women, mean [standard deviation] age = 66.91 [8.88] years) from the Health and Retirement Study provided data on cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune markers at baseline and personality both at baseline and at 4 years later. Results: Higher allostatic load was related to higher neuroticism (beta = 0.03, p = .042), lower extraversion (beta = -0.06, p < .001), and lower conscientiousness (beta = -0.06, p < .001) at baseline, and to declines in extraversion (beta = -0.03, p = .007), conscientiousness (beta = -0.04, p < .001), and agreeableness (beta = -0.02, p = .020) over the 4-year period, controlling for demographic covariates. A significant quadratic relation between allostatic load and changes in openness (beta = -0.03, p = .002) suggested that openness declines when individuals exceed a high level of cumulative physiological dysregulation. No association was found with changes in neuroticism. Conclusions: Allostatic load is associated with personality change across adulthood and old age. The findings indicate that physiological dysregulation across multiple systems challenges personality stability and is associated with accelerated personality traits change.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Endocrine cells of the pituitary gland secrete a number of hormones, and the amount of hormone released by a cell is controlled in large part by the cell's electrical activity and subsequent Ca2+ influx. Typical electrical behaviors of pituitary cells include continuous spiking and so-called pseudo-plateau bursting. It has been shown that the amplitude of Ca2+ fluctuations is greater in bursting cells, leading to the hypothesis that bursting cells release more hormone than spiking cells. In this work, we apply computer simulations to test this hypothesis. We use experimental recordings of electrical activity as input to mathematical models of Ca2+ channel activity, buffered Ca2+ diffusion, and Ca2+ driven exocytosis. To compare the efficacy of spiking and bursting on the same cell, we pharmacologically block the large-conductance potassium (BK) current from a bursting cell or add a BK current to a spiking cell via dynamic clamp. We find that bursting is generally at least as effective as spiking at evoking hormone release and is often considerably more effective, even when normalizing to Ca2+ influx. Our hybrid experimental/modeling approach confirms that adding a BK-type K+ current, which is typically associated with decreased cell activity and reduced secretion, can actually produce an increase in hormone secretion, as suggested earlier.",

Effects of vibration on leg blood flow after intense exercise and its influence on subsequent exercise performance. J Strength Cond Res 30(4): 1111-1117, 2016-This study aimed to determine the effects of vibration on leg blood flow after intense exercise and find out whether or not these effects can influence subsequent maximal exercise performance. Twenty-three participants performed an exercise test-to-exhaustion followed by a recovery period using six 1-minute sets of whole-body vibration (WBV; 25 Hz-4 mm) or a passive control (noWBV; 0 Hz-0 mm) in the seated position on separate days in random order. Blood flow was assessed at baseline and during each 1-minute interset rest periods post-WBV and noWBV. Thereafter, participants performed a cycle-ergometer test, and time to exhaustion and total distance covered (TDC) were recorded. During recovery, a similar trend was observed in both systolic and diastolic peak frequency dynamics in both conditions. The pulsatility index decreased (p < 0.01) from baseline during postbout 1 in both trials and during post-4 and post-5 in the WBV trial. Significant between-group differences were observed during post-4 (p <= 0.05) with greater decreases in pulsatility index after WBV compared with noWBV. Time to exhaustion and TDC were higher after WBV compared with noWBV. In conclusion, WBV decreased pulsatility index in the popliteal artery after maximal exercise and was effective to increase performance in a later exercise test-to-exhaustion.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The swamp type of the Asian water buffalo is assumed to have been domesticated by about 4000years BP, following the introduction of rice cultivation. Previous localizations of the domestication site were based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation within China, accounting only for the maternal lineage. We carried out a comprehensive sampling of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Nepal and Bangladesh and sequenced the mtDNA Cytochrome b gene and control region and the Y-chromosomal ZFY, SRY and DBY sequences. Swamp buffalo has a higher diversity of both maternal and paternal lineages than river buffalo, with also a remarkable contrast between a weak phylogeographic structure of river buffalo and a strong geographic differentiation of swamp buffalo. The highest diversity of the swamp buffalo maternal lineages was found in south China and north Indochina on both banks of the Mekong River, while the highest diversity in paternal lineages was in the China/Indochina border region. We propose that domestication in this region was later followed by introgressive capture of wild cows west of the Mekong. Migration to the north followed the Yangtze valley as well as a more eastern route, but also involved translocations of both cows and bulls over large distances with a minor influence of river buffaloes in recent decades. Bayesian analyses of various migration models also supported domestication in the China/Indochina border region. Coalescence analysis yielded consistent estimates for the expansion of the major swamp buffalo haplogroups with a credibility interval of 900 to 3900years BP. The spatial differentiation of mtDNA and Y-chromosomal haplotype distributions indicates a lack of gene flow between established populations that is unprecedented in livestock.",

Changes in family life and in the association between families' economic conditions and the macro economy provide reason to question the continued existence of a recession effect. This article evaluates the frequency of married and cohabiting fathers' engagement in the day-to-day tasks of child care during the so-called Great Recession, using data from male respondents to the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. Results indicated an increase in men's frequency of engagement in physical care and feeding, starting in 2008 and continuing into 2010. The share of men engaged in daily play fell sharply at the recession's onset but rebounded in subsequent years. These results suggest that, even with a narrowing of the gendered division of domestic labor, room remains for families to respond flexibly to economic shifts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "BACKGROUND: The value of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in predicting clinical outcomes has been investigated in a variety of neurological disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of serum NSE with severity of bleeding and functional outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with SAH from June 2008 to June 2012. The severity of SAH bleeding at admission was measured radiographically with the Fisher scale and clinically with the Glasgow Coma Scale, Hunt and Hess grade, and World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons scale. Outcomes were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale at discharge. RESULTS: We identified 309 patients with nontraumatic SAH, and 71 had NSE testing. Median age was 54 years (range, 23-87 years), and 44% were male. In multivariable analysis, increased NSE was associated with a poorer Hunt and Hess grade (P = .003), World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons scale score (P < .001), and Glasgow Coma Scale score (P = .003) and worse outcomes (modified Rankin Scale at discharge; P = .001). There was no significant association between NSE level and Fisher grade (P = .81) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between higher NSE levels and poorer clinical presentations and worse outcomes. Although it is still early for any relevant clinical conclusions, our results suggest that NSE holds promise as a tool for screening patients at increased risk of poor outcomes after SAH.

      "Abstract Note" : "Despite considerable progress in unravelling the phylogenetic relationships of microhylid frogs, relationships among subfamilies remain largely unstable and many genera are not demonstrably monophyletic. Here, we used five alternative combinations of DNA sequence data (ranging from seven loci for 48 taxa to up to 73 loci for as many as 142 taxa) generated using the anchored phylogenomics sequencing method (66 loci, derived from conserved genome regions, for 48 taxa) and Sanger sequencing (seven loci for up to 142 taxa) to tackle this problem. We assess the effects of character sampling, taxon sampling, analytical methods and assumptions in phylogenetic inference of microhylid frogs. The phylogeny of microhylids shows high susceptibility to different analytical methods and datasets used for the analyses. Clades inferred from maximum-likelihood are generally more stable across datasets than those inferred from parsimony. Parsimony trees inferred within a tree-alignment framework are generally better resolved and better supported than those inferred within a similarity-alignment framework, even under the same cost matrix (equally weighted) and same treatment of gaps (as a fifth nucleotide state). We discuss potential causes for these differences in resolution and clade stability among discovery operations. We also highlight the problem that commonly used algorithms for model-based analyses do not explicitly model insertion and deletion events (i.e. gaps are treated as missing data). Our results corroborate the monophyly of Microhylidae and most currently recognized subfamilies but fail to provide support for relationships among subfamilies. Several taxonomic updates are provided, including naming of two new subfamilies, both monotypic.",

Any persistence with such actions is said to be suboptimal, attributable to factors such as threat rigidities. This paper theorizes that persistence may sometimes be rational, attributable to the characteristics of feedback. It uses a novel dataset of medical devices to show how organizations learn to search for future novel or incremental innovations based on failure. It finds that firms change innovation activities when novel innovations fail, but persist when incremental innovations fail. These findings support the hypothesis that inferences based on failure from incremental innovations tend to be more robust, leading firms to be more willing to persist when failure occurs.

Here we report the study of a novel LIC by employing in situ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) as a nondestructive tool, revealing the sequence of electrochemical processes in it. We have performed in situ Li-7 NMR experiments on the LIC by simultaneously cycling the LIC pouch cell in the voltage range 2.0-4.0 V. NMR spectra recorded for multiple cycles reveal the Li-7 NMR signals arising from different parts of the capacitor. By employing a combination of in situ Li-7 NMR, component isolation, and Gaussian-Lorentzian peak fitting, we investigate the resonances arising from the Li metal from stabilized lithium metal powder (SLMP), free ions in electrolyte, the solid electrolyte interface layer (SEI), intercalated lithium in carbon anode, and the Li ions in the electric double layer on cathode. The recorded in situ Li-7 NMR spectra showed that the charge and discharge processes caused electrochemical reactions, resulting in considerable repetitive changes in peak intensities and chemical shifts over multiple cycles. Further cycle experiments revealed contributions from individual electrodes. This series of experiments aid in the visualization of the Li ion transfer mechanisms in LICs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The structure and functions of the M2 protein from Influenza A are sensitive to pH, cholesterol, and the antiinfluenza drug Amantadine. This is a tetrameric membrane protein of 97 amino-acid residues that has multiple functions, among them as a proton-selective channel and facilitator of viral budding, replacing the need for the ESCRT proteins that other viruses utilize. Here, various amino-acid-specific-labeled samples of the full-length protein were prepared and mixed, so that only inter-residue C-13-C-13 cross peaks between two differently labeled proteins representing interhelical interactions are observed. This channel is activated at slightly acidic pH values in the endosome when the His 37 residues in the middle of the transmembrane domain take on a +2 or +3 charged state. Changes observed here in interhelical distances in the N-terminus can be accounted for by modest structural changes, and no significant changes in structure were detected in the C-terminal portion of the channel upon activation of the channel. Amantadine, which blocks proton conductance by binding in the aqueous pore near the N-terminus, however, significantly modifies the tetrameric structure on the opposite side of the membrane. The interactions between the juxtamembrane amphipathic helix of one monomer and its neighboring monomer observed in the absence of drug are disrupted in its presence. However, the addition of cholesterol prevents this structural disruption. In fact, strong interactions are observed between cholesterol and residues in the amphipathic helix, accounting for cholesterol binding adjacent to a native palmitoylation site and near to an interhelix crevice that is typical of cholesterol binding sites. The resultant stabilization of the amphipathic helix deep in the bilayer interface facilitates the bilayer curvature that is essential for viral budding.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Quantum computing is an emerging area within the information sciences revolving around the concept of quantum bits (qubits). A major obstacle is the extreme fragility of these qubits due to interactions with their environment that destroy their quantumness. This phenomenon, known as decoherence, is of fundamental interest(1,2). There are many competing candidates for qubits, including superconducting circuits(3), quantum optical cavities(4), ultracold atoms(5) and spin qubits(6-8), and each has its strengths and weaknesses. When dealing with spin qubits, the strongest source of decoherence is the magnetic dipolar interaction(9). To minimize it, spins are typically diluted in a diamagnetic matrix. For example, this dilution can be taken to the extreme of a single phosphorus atom in silicon(6), whereas in molecular matrices a typical ratio is one magnetic molecule per 10,000 matrix molecules(10). However, there is a fundamental contradiction between reducing decoherence by dilution and allowing quantum operations via the interaction between spin qubits. To resolve this contradiction, the design and engineering of quantum hardware can benefit from a 'bottom-up' approach whereby the electronic structure of magnetic molecules is chemically tailored to give the desired physical behaviour. Here we present a way of enhancing coherence in solid-state molecular spin qubits without resorting to extreme dilution. It is based on the design of molecular structures with crystal field ground states possessing large tunnelling gaps that give rise to optimal operating points, or atomic clock transitions, at which the quantum spin dynamics become protected against dipolar decoherence. This approach is illustrated with a holmium molecular nanomagnet in which long coherence times (up to 8.4 microseconds at 5 kelvin) are obtained at unusually high concentrations. This finding opens new avenues for quantum computing based on molecular spin qubits.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Islets of Langerhans are the regulators of in vivo blood glucose levels through the secretion of endocrine hormones. Amino acids, released from various cells within islets or from intrapancreatic neurons, are hypothesized to further adjust hormone secretions. In contrast to the well-accepted mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, several questions remain as to the function of amino adds in the regulation of hormone release from islets. To understand the autocrine and paracrine roles that amino acids play in islet physiology, a microfluidic system was developed to perform online monitoring of the secretion profiles of amino acids from 2-5 islets. The device-contained an islet chamber with the ability to perfuse stimulants and ant amino acid measurement system with derivatization and electrophoretic separation integrated on a single microchip. The setup was optimized to allow -15 kV to be applied to the device for high efficiency and rapid separations of derivatized amino acids. The compositions of:the derivatization and separation buffers were optimized to prevent precipitations in the channels, which allowed continuous monitoring of-Secretion for over 2 h. With this method, 10 amino acids were resolved with limits of detection ranging from 1 to 20 nM. When murine islets were perfused with 3 mM glucose, the secretion rates of 9 amino acids were measured and ranged from 30 to 400 fmol islet(-1) min(-1). As,the glucose concentration was increased to 20 mM, the dynamic changes of amino acids were monitored. The biological relevance of the amino acid secretions was. verified using 2,4-dinitrophenoi as an inhibitor of the proton motive force. The microfluidic system was also:used to measure dynamic changes of amino add release from human islets, which showed different release profiles compared to their murine counterparts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Spamming botnets present a critical challenge in the control of spam messages because of the sheer volume and wide spread of the botnet members. In this paper, we advocate the approach for recipient mail servers to filter messages directly delivered from remote end-user (EU) machines, given that the majority of spamming bots are EU machines. We develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier to separate EU machines from legitimate mail server (LMS) machines, using a set of machine features that cannot be easily manipulated by spammers. We investigate the efficacy and performance of the SVM-based classifier using a number of real-world data sets. Our performance studies show that the SVM-based classifier is indeed a feasible and effective approach in distinguishing EU machines from LMS machines. For example, training and testing on an aggregated data set containing both EU machines and LMS machines, on average, we found that the SVM-based classifier can achieve a 99.25% detection accuracy, with very small false positive rate (0.35%) and false negative rate (1.27%), significantly outperforming eight Domain Name System-based blacklists widely used today.

      "Abstract Note" : "We describe the synthesis of two metal-coordinating ligands that present one or two lipoic acid (LA) anchors, a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment and a terminal reactive group made of an azide or an aldehyde, two functionalities with great utility in bio-orthogonal coupling techniques. These ligands were introduced onto the QD surfaces using a combination of photochemical ligation and mixed cap exchange strategy, where control over the fraction of azide and aldehyde groups per nanocrystal can be easily achieved: LA-PEG-CHO, LA -PEG -N3, and bis(LA)-PEG-CHO. We then demonstrate the application of two novel bio-orthogonal coupling strategies directly on luminescent quantum dot (QD) surfaces that use click chemistry and hydrazone ligation under catalyst-free conditions. We applied the highly efficient hydrazone ligation to couple 2-hydrozinopyridine (2-HP) to aldehyde-functionalized QDs, which produces a stable hydrazone chromophore with a well-defined optical signature. This unique optical feature has enabled us to extract a measure for the ligand density on the QDs for a few distinct sizes and for different ligand architectures, namely mono-LA-PEG and bis(LA)-PEG. We found that the foot-print-area per ligand was unaffected by the nanocrystal size but strongly depended on the ligand coordination number. Additionally, we showed that when the two bio-orthogonal functionalities (aldehyde and azide) are combined on the same QD platform, the nanocrystal can be specifically reacted with two distinct targets and with great specificity. This design yields QD platforms with distinct chemoselectivities that are greatly promising for use as carriers for in vivo imaging and delivery.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a commonly known toxic gas compound, possesses unique chemical features that allow this small solute molecule to quickly diffuse through cell membranes. Taking advantage of the recent orthogonal space tempering (OST) method, we comparatively mapped the transmembrane free energy landscapes of H2S and its structural analogue, water (H2O), seeking to decipher the molecular determinants that govern their drastically different permeabilities. As revealed by our OST sampling results, in contrast to the highly polar water solute, hydrogen sulfide is evidently amphipathic, and thus inside membrane is favorably localized at the interfacial region, that is, the interface between the polar head-group and nonpolar acyl chain regions. Because the membrane binding affinity of H2S is mainly governed by its small hydrophobic moiety and the barrier height inbetween the interfacial region and the membrane center is largely determined by its moderate polarity, the transmembrane free energy barriers to encounter by this toxic molecule are very small. Moreover when H2S diffuses from the bulk solution to the membrane center, the above two effects nearly cancel each other, so as to lead to a negligible free energy difference. This study not only explains why H2S can quickly pass through cell membranes but also provides a practical illustration on how to use the OST free energy sampling method to conveniently analyze complex molecular processes.

      "Abstract Note" : "We report plasmon-mediated two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL)-detected circular dichroism (CD) from colloidal metal nanoparticle assemblies. Two classes of solid gold nanosphere (SGN) dimers-heterodimers and homodimers-were examined using polarization-resolved TPPL, second harmonic generation (SHG), and one-photon photoluminescence (OPPL). Unambiguous CD was detected in both the TPPL and SHG signals, and the magnitudes of the CD responses in these measurements showed agreement for individual nanostructures. Heterodimers gave larger CD responses (average TPPL-CDR = 0.62 +/- 0.33; average SHG-CDR = 0.51 +/- 0.21) than homodimers (average TPPL-CDR = 0.19 +/- 0.04; average SHG-CDR = 0.18 +/- 0.06). OPPL-CD was not detected for either structure. Analysis of dimer emission properties suggested the CD responses were determined by properties of the one-photon-resonant mode excited by the laser. Average TPPL signals were (4.3 +/- 0.6)x larger than those for SHG. Because signal amplitude is a primary determinant for spatial accuracies and precisions obtained from optical microscopy, CD contrast generated from plasmon-mediated TPPL, which we report for the first time, can extend the suite of super-resolution imaging techniques.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We demonstrate that the action of physical pressure, chemical compression, or aliovalent substitution in ACo(2)As(2) (A = Eu and Ca) has a general consequence of causing these antiferromagnetic materials to become ferromagnets. In all cases, the mixed valence triggered at the electropositive A site results in the increase of the Co 3d density of states at the Fermi level. Remarkably, the dramatic alteration of magnetic behavior results from the very minor (<0.15 eleetron) change in the population of the 3d orbitals. The mixed valence state of En observed in the high-pressure (HP) form of EuCo2As2 exhibits a remarkable stability, achieving the average oxidation state of +2.25 at 12.6 GPa. In the case of CaCo2As2, substituting even 10% of Eu or La into the Ca site causes ferromagnetic ordering of Co moments. Similar to HP-EuCo2As2, the itinerant 3d ferromagnetism emerges from electronic doping into the Co layer because of chemical compression of Eu sites in Ca0.9Eu0.1Co1.91As2 or direct electron doping in Ca0.85La0.15Co1.89As2. The results reported herein demonstrate the general possibility of amplifying minor localized electronic effects to achieve major changes in material's properties via involvement of strongly correlated electrons.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Pericyclic reactions bypass high-energy reactive intermediates by synchronizing bond formation and bond cleavage. The present work offers two strategies for uncoupling these two processes and converting concerted processes into their \"interrupted\" versions by combining Au(I) catalysis with electronic and stereoelectronic factors. First, we show how the alignment of the C3-C4 bond with the adjacent pi systems can control the reactivity and how the concerted scission of the central 6 bond is prevented in the boat conformation. Second, the introduction of a fluorine atom at C3 also interrupts the sigmatropic shift and changes the rate-determining step of the interrupted cascade from the 6-endo-dig nucleophilic attack to the fragmentation of the central C3-C4 bond. Furthermore, this effect strongly depends on the relative orientation of the C-F bond toward the developing cationic center. The equatorial C-F bond has a much greater destabilizing effect on TS2 due to the more efficient through-bond interaction between the acceptor and the cationic yr system. In contrast, the axial C-F bond is not aligned with the bridging C-C bonds and does not impose an equally strong deactivating stereoelectronic effect. These differences illustrate that the competition between concerted and interrupted pericyclic pathways can be finely tuned via a combination of structural and electronic effects modulated by conformational equilibria. The combination of Au(I) catalysis and C-F-mediated stereoelectronic gating delays the central bond scission, opening access to the interrupted Cope rearrangements and expanding the scope of this classic reaction to the design of new cascade transformations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this article, we examine depictions of race, nature, and childhood in Harlan Ingersoll Smith's early ethnographic films at the National Museum of Canada. Created in the 1920s for a children's education programme, Smith's films construct ethnographic portraits of different Indigenous peoples in Western Canada. We demonstrate how museum education appropriated Indigeneity as a discursive resource to immerse viewing children in particular narratives of Canadian national heritage and development. The films worked through a complex double movement, bringing children in the Ottawa museum audience into association with Indigenous children based on shared experience as children while simultaneously differentiating Indigenous peoples as Other. The films inculcated white youth at the museum in a romanticized connection to Canada's prehistory through knowledge of the nation's Indigenous peoples as well as nature. In the films, the position of Indigeneity within the future remained ambiguous (traditional practices sometimes disappearing, sometimes enduring). Yet, despite Smith's uncertainty about colonial beliefs in the disappearance of Indigeneity, his films nonetheless presented the teleological development of the settler nation as certain. Our article highlights how thinking about children, as audience for and thematic focus of these films, extends discussions of the geographies of film, of children, and of settler colonial nationalism.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Problem The amount of time medical students must devote to the residency application process has increased, often at the expense of students' education. The fourth year is still a crucial component of medical education, especially for preparing students for the transition to residency. Approach To maintain flexibility during the residency interview season and provide students with the opportunity to hone critical skills, faculty at the Florida State University College of Medicine developed a literature and medicine distance learning elective for fourth-year students. The four-week course was offered five times per academic year from 2012 to 2014. Participating students and faculty chose a topic and reading list, which guided both students' written reflections and the weekly discussions held via video conference. Nineteen students participated, and 13 completed a postcourse survey to gauge their overall impressions of the elective and its effects on their learning. Outcomes Participants valued the course for six principal reasons: It (1) provided the opportunity to consider others' perspectives, (2) improved their ability to think as a physician and examine personal biases, (3) provided the opportunity to discuss nonmedical literature, (4) provided the opportunity to use different cognitive skills, (5) afforded flexibility, and (6) improved their ability to communicate about difficult topics. Next Steps The long-term value of a distance learning elective in the humanities remains uncertain. The authors have begun to study students' perceptions of the elective's value after entering residency. However, they believe that the initial positive feedback justifies the course's replication at other institutions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: Youths with disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) (conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder) have an elevated risk for maladaptive reactive aggression. Theory suggests that this is due to an elevated sensitivity of basic threat circuitry implicated in retaliation (amygdala/periaqueductal gray) in youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits and dysfunctional regulatory activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in youths with DBD irrespective of callous-unemotional traits. Method: A total of 56 youths 10-18 years of age (23 of them female) participated in the study: 30 youths with DBD, divided by median split into groups with high and low levels of callousunemotional traits, and 26 healthy youths. All participants completed an ultimatum game task during functional MRI. Results: Relative to the other groups, youths with DBD and low levels of callous-unemotional traits showed greater increases in activation of basic threat circuitry when punishing others and dysfunctional down-regulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during retaliation. Relative to healthy youths, all youths with DBD showed reduced amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity during high provocation. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex responsiveness and ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity were related to patients' retaliatory propensity (behavioral responses during the task) and parent-reported reactive aggression. Conclusions: These data suggest differences in the underlying neurobiology of maladaptive reactive aggression in youths with DBD who have relatively low levels of callousunemotional traits. Youths with DBD and low callousunemotional traits alone showed significantly greater threat responses during retaliation relative to comparison subjects. These data also suggest that ventromedial prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity is critical for regulating retaliation/reactive aggression and, when dysfunctional, contributes to reactive aggression, independent of level of callous-unemotional traits.",

This reduces the deterrence of serious crimes that do provide strong signals regarding the offender's character. Over-criminalization occurs when the costs associated with reduced deterrence due to stigma dilution off-set potential benefits associated with criminalizing the less harmful act. Identifying conditions under which stigma dilution is likely and comparatively costly allows the determination of factors that affect the desirability of (de)criminalizing various acts. These factors are discussed in the context of marijuana possession offenses to illustrate how over-criminalization may reduce social welfare. The normative desirability of various practices in criminal law are also discussed vis-A -vis their impacts on stigma dilution.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often seeks to influence countries' domestic public policy via varying levels of conditionalitylinking financial support to borrowing governments' commitment to policy reforms. When does extensive conditionality encourage domestic economic reforms and when does it impede them? We argue that, rather than universally benefiting or harming reforms, the effects of stricter IMF conditionality depend on domestic partisan politics. More IMF conditions can pressure left-wing governments into undertaking more ambitious reforms with little resistance from partisan rivals on the right; under right governments, however, more conditions hinder reform implementation by heightening resistance from the left while simultaneously reducing leaders' ability to win their support through concessions or compromise. Using data on post-communist IMF programs for the period 1994-2010, we find robust evidence supporting these claims, even after addressing the endogeneity of IMF programs via instrumental variables analysis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We assess the ability of logit, probit and numerous other parametric models to test a hypothesis that two variables interact in influencing the probability that some event will occur [Pr(Y)] in what we believe is a very common situation: when one's theory is insufficiently strong to dictate a specific functional form for the data generating process. Using Monte Carlo analysis, we find that many models yield overconfident inferences by generating 95% confidence intervals for estimates of the strength of interaction that are far too narrow, but that some logit and probit models produce approximately accurate intervals. Yet all models we study generate point estimates for the strength of interaction with large enough average error to often distort substantive conclusions. We propose an approach to make the most effective use of logit and probit in the situation of specification uncertainty, but argue that nonparametric models may ultimately prove to be superior.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Differential processing of threat can consummate as early as 100 ms post-stimulus. Moreover, early perception not only differentiates threat from non-threat stimuli but also distinguishes among discrete threat subtypes (e.g. fear, disgust and anger). Combining spatial-frequency-filtered images of fear, disgust and neutral scenes with high-density event-related potentials and intracranial source estimation, we investigated the neural underpinnings of general and specific threat processing in early stages of perception. Conveyed in low spatial frequencies, fear and disgust images evoked convergent visual responses with similarly enhanced N1 potentials and dorsal visual (middle temporal gyrus) cortical activity (relative to neutral cues; peaking at 156 ms). Nevertheless, conveyed in high spatial frequencies, fear and disgust elicited divergent visual responses, with fear enhancing and disgust suppressing P1 potentials and ventral visual (occipital fusiform) cortical activity (peaking at 121 ms). Therefore, general and specific threat processing operates in parallel in early perception, with the ventral visual pathway engaged in specific processing of discrete threats and the dorsal visual pathway in general threat processing. Furthermore, selectively tuned to distinctive spatial-frequency channels and visual pathways, these parallel processes underpin dimensional and categorical threat characterization, promoting efficient threat response. These findings thus lend support to hybrid models of emotion.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Three challenges compromise the utility of mathematical models of groundwater and other environmental systems: (1) a dizzying array of model analysis methods and metrics make it difficult to compare evaluations of model adequacy, sensitivity, and uncertainty; (2) the high computational demands of many popular model analysis methods (requiring 1000's, 10,000s, or more model runs) make them difficult to apply to complex models; and (3) many models are plagued by unrealistic nonlinearities arising from the numerical model formulation and implementation. This study proposes a strategy to address these challenges through a careful combination of model analysis and implementation methods. In this strategy, computationally frugal model analysis methods (often requiring a few dozen parallelizable model runs) play a major role, and computationally demanding methods are used for problems where (relatively) inexpensive diagnostics suggest the frugal methods are unreliable. We also argue in favor of detecting and, where possible, eliminating unrealistic model nonlinearitiesthis increases the realism of the model itself and facilitates the application of frugal methods. Literature examples are used to demonstrate the use of frugal methods and associated diagnostics. We suggest that the strategy proposed in this paper would allow the environmental sciences community to achieve greater transparency and falsifiability of environmental models, and obtain greater scientific insight from ongoing and future modeling efforts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "ObjectivePurging behaviors, including self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and diuretic abuse, are present across many of the eating disorders. Here we review the major medical complications of these behaviors. MethodAlthough we identified over 100 scholarly articles describing medical complications associated with purging, most papers involved case studies or small, uncontrolled samples. Given the limited evidence base, we conducted a qualitative (rather than systematic) review to identify medical complications that have been attributed to purging behaviors. ResultsMedical conditions affecting the teeth, esophagus, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, skin, cardiovascular system, and musculoskeletal system were identified, with self-induced vomiting causing the most medical complications. DiscussionPurging behavior can be associated with severe medical complications across all body systems. Mental health professionals should refer patients with purging behaviors to medical providers for screening and treatment as needed. The medical work-up for individuals with eating disorders should include a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and a full body exam including the teeth to prevent severe complications. Medical providers should screen patients for purging behaviors and associated medical complications, even in the absence of an eating disorder diagnosis, to increase the detection of eating disorders. Recognizing the link between purging and medical complications can aid in identifying potential eating disorders, particularly those that often elude detection such as purging disorder. Resumen ObjetivoLos comportamientos purgativos, incluyendo el vomito autoinducido, abuso de laxantes, y abuso de diureticos, estan presentes en muchos de los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria. En este articulo nosotros revisamos las principales complicaciones medicas de estos comportamientos. MetodoAunque hemos identificado mas de 100 articulos academicos describiendo las complicaciones medicas asociadas con la purgacion, la mayoria de los articulos involucran estudios de caso o muestras pequenas y sin controles. Dada la limitada evidencia, realizamos una revision cualitativa (en lugar de sistematica) para identificar las complicaciones medicas que se han atribuido a las conductas purgativas. ResultadosFueron identificadas las condiciones medicas que afectan los dientes, esofago, sistema gastrointestinal, rinones, piel, sistema cardiovascular, y sistema musculoesqueletico, siendo el vomito autoinducido el que causa las mayores complicaciones medicas. ConclusionesLos comportamientos purgativos pueden ser asociados con complicaciones medicas severas en todos los sistemas del cuerpo. Los profesionales de la salud mental deben referir los pacientes con comportamientos purgativos a los medicos para la deteccion y tratamiento segun sea necesario. El estudio diagnostico medico para los individuos con trastorno de la conducta alimentaria debe incluir un panel metabolico exhaustivo, biometria hematica completa, y un examen fisico completo incluyendo los dientes para prevenir complicaciones severas. Los proveedores de servicios medicos deben evaluar a los pacientes para comportamientos purgativos y las complicaciones medicas asociadas, aun en ausencia de un diagnostico de trastorno de la conducta alimentaria, para incrementar la deteccion de trastornos alimentarios. Reconocer el vinculo entre las purgaciones y las complicaciones medicas puede ayudar a la identificacion de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria potenciales, particularmente aquellos que a menudo escapan a la deteccion como el trastorno por purgas.

      "Abstract Note" : "During summer 2010, we investigated phytoplankton production and growth rates at 19 stations in the eastern tropical Pacific, where winds and strong opposing currents generate the Costa Rica Dome (CRD), an open-ocean upwelling feature. Primary production (C-14-incorporation) and group-specific growth and net growth rates (two-treatment sea-water dilution method) were estimated from samples incubated in situ at eight depths. Our cruise coincided with a mild El Nino event, and only weak upwelling was observed in the CRD. Nevertheless, the highest phytoplankton abundances were found near the dome center. However, mixed-layer growth rates were lowest in the dome center (similar to 0.5-0.9 day(-1)), but higher on the edge of the dome (similar to 0.9-1.0 day(-1)) and in adjacent coastal waters (0.9-1.3 day(-1)). We found good agreement between independent methods to estimate growth rates. Mixed-layer growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were largely balanced by mortality, whereas eukaryotic phytoplankton showed positive net growth (similar to 0.5-0.6 day(-1)), that is, growth available to support larger (mesozooplankton) consumer biomass. These are the first group-specific phytoplankton rate estimates in this region, and they demonstrate that integrated primary production is high, exceeding 1 g C m(-2) day(-1) on average, even during a period of reduced upwelling.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We determined the net rate of biogenic silica (bSiO(2)) production and estimated the diatom contribution to new production and organic matter export in the Costa Rica Dome during summer 2010. The shallow thermocline significantly reduces bSiO(2) dissolution rates below the mixed layer, leading to significant enhancement of bSiO(2) relative to organic matter (silicate-pump condition). This may explain why deep export of bSiO(2) in this region is elevated by an order of magnitude relative to comparable systems. Diatom carbon, relative to autotrophic carbon, was low (<3%); however, the contribution of diatoms to new production averaged 3 and 13% using independent approaches. The 4-old discrepancy between methods may be explained by a low average C:Si ratio (similar to 1.4) for the net produced diatom C relative to the net produced bSiO(2). We speculate that this low production ratio is not the result of reduced C, but may arise from a significant contribution of non-diatom silicifying organisms to bSiO(2) production. The contribution of diatoms to organic matter export was minor (5.7%). These results, and those of the broader project, suggest substantial food-web transformation of diatom organic matter in the euphotic zone, which creates enriched bSiO(2) relative to organic matter within the exported material.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We investigated standing stocks and grazing rates of mesozooplankton assemblages in the Costa Rica Dome (CRD), an open-ocean upwelling ecosystem in the eastern tropical Pacific. While phytoplankton biomass in the CRD is dominated by picophytoplankton (<2-mu m cells) with especially high concentrations of Synechococcus spp., we found high mesozooplankton biomass (similar to 5 g dry weight m(-2)) and grazing impact (12-50% integrated water column chlorophyll a), indicative of efficient food web transfer from primary producers to higher levels. In contrast to the relative uniformity in water-column chlorophyll a and mesozooplankton biomass, variability in herbivory was substantial, with lower rates in the central dome region and higher rates in areas offset from the dome center. While grazing rates were unrelated to total phytoplankton, correlations with cyanobacteria (negative) and biogenic SiO2 production (positive) suggest that partitioning of primary production among phytoplankton sizes contributes to the variability observed in mesozooplankton metrics. We propose that advection of upwelled waters away from the dome center is accompanied by changes in mesozooplankton composition and grazing rates, reflecting small changes within the primary producers. Small changes within the phytoplankton community resulting in large changes in the mesozooplankton suggest that the variability in lower trophic level dynamics was effectively amplified through the food web.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Costa Rica Dome is a picophytoplankton-dominated, open-ocean upwelling system in the Eastern Tropical Pacific that overlies the ocean's largest oxygen minimum zone. To investigate the efficiency of the biological pump in this unique area, we used shallow (90-150 m) drifting sediment traps and Th-234: U-238 deficiency measurements to determine export fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in sinking particles. Simultaneous measurements of nitrate uptake and shallow water nitrification allowed us to assess the equilibrium balance of new and export production over a monthly timescale. While f-ratios (new: total production) were reasonably high (0.36+/-0.12, mean+/-standard deviation), export efficiencies were considerably lower. Sediment traps suggested e-ratios (export/C-14-primary production) at 90-100 m ranging from 0.053 to 0.067. ThE-ratios (Th-234 disequilibrium-derived export) ranged from 0.038 to 0.088. C: N and N: P stoichiometries of sinking material were both greater than canonical (Redfield) ratios or measured C: N of suspended particulates, and they increased with depth, suggesting that both nitrogen and phosphorus were preferentially remineralized from sinking particles. Our results are consistent with an ecosystem in which mesozooplankton play a major role in energy transfer to higher trophic levels but are relatively inefficient in mediating vertical carbon flux to depth, leading to an imbalance between new production and sinking flux.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We investigated phytoplankton production rates and grazing fates in the Costa Rica Dome (CRD) during summer 2010 based on dilution depth profiles analyzed by flow cytometry and pigments and mesozooplankton grazing assessed by gut fluorescence. Three community production estimates, from C-14 uptake (1025+/-113 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) and from dilution experiments analyzed for total Chla (990+/-106 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) and flow cytometry populations (862+/-71 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), exceeded regional ship-based values by 2-3-fold. Picophytoplankton accounted for 56% of community biomass and 39% of production. Production profiles extended deeper for Prochlorococcus (PRO) and picoeukaryotes than for Synechococcus (SYN) and larger eukaryotes, but 93% of total production occurred above 40 m. Microzooplankton consumed all PRO and SYN growth and two-third of total production. Positive net growth of larger eukaryotes in the upper 40 m was balanced by independently measured consumption by mesozooplankton. Among larger eukaryotes, diatoms contributed similar to 3% to production. On the basis of this analysis, the CRD region is characterized by high production and grazing turnover, comparable with or higher than estimates for the eastern equatorial Pacific. The region nonetheless displays characteristics atypical of high productivity, such as picophytoplankton dominance and suppressed diatom roles.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Objective: This article examines local health department (LHD) participation and intentions to participate in national voluntary accreditation and reasons for not seeking accreditation. Specifically, it compares the results of national surveys among LHDs in 2010, 2013, and 2014. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: United States. Participants: LHDs that responded to the 2014 Forces of Change Survey and the 2010 and 2013 National Association of County and City Health Officials Profile studies. Main Outcome Measures: LHD level of engagement in Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) accreditation. Results: Data of 2014 indicated that 1% of LHDs achieved accreditation and 11% had submitted an application or a statement of intent, compared with 6% of LHDs that submitted an application or a statement of intent in 2013. The percent of LHDs that indicated they planned to apply for accreditation but had not submitted a statement of intent declined from 27% in 2013 to 22% in 2014. In multivariate models, controlling for governance category and jurisdiction population size, LHDs in states where the state health department (SHD) participated in e-PHAB had higher odds of being favorably inclined toward accreditation than those located in states where the SHD was not in the e-PHAB system (odds ratio = 2.82, 95% confidence interval: 1.81-4.41). Across 2013 and 2014, and across small and large LHDs, the top 2 reasons for deciding not to apply for accreditation were the time/effort required exceeded the benefits (67%) and fees were too high (46%). Conclusions: SHDs are powerful mediators of LHDs' perceptions of the PHAB accreditation program. Health department governance structure and jurisdiction population size are associated with LHD accreditation participation decisions. With the launch of PHAB's program, fewer LHDs are undecided about accreditation participation and many have taken affirmative steps to become accredited. The top 2 reasons LHDs indicated for not proceeding with accreditation were time/effort exceed benefit and fees perceived as too high.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We advance and test a theory of grant compliance in single-shot games by combining the insights on grant management from Pressman and Wildavsky's classic work with the role that goal congruence and local political institutions play in the intergovernmental grant process. One-time grants, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, require unique grant management techniques on the part of the federal government and local political institutions to foster credible commitments between federal and local authorities. Based on administrative records from the U.S. Department of Energy and a national survey of local government recipients of DOE grants, we predict delay in expending grant funds given that the goal of the federal government is to rapidly stimulate the economy and produce gains in energy efficiency. We employ survival modeling to estimate the time from receipt of a stimulus grant until the funds are expended. We find compelling evidence that effective grant management and local government institutions and policies are salient for limiting delays.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The research question raised is this study is: what factors affect state agencies' decisions to outsource oversight? The outsourcing of oversight here is conceptualized as a distinct occurrence of collaborative monitoring that expands the traditional principal-agent dyad common in the contracting literature to a small network of three agents. The adoption of the Recovery Act (ARRA) of 2009 presents a workload surge for state agencies that need to implement novel monitoring requirements in addition to their traditional practices regarding the management of grants and contracts. As an external factor creating a dynamic contracting environment the Act is hypothesized to increase the probability that state agencies outsource oversight. Additionally professional capacity is also a factor that might affect state agencies' decision to contract out monitoring functions. Results from logistic regressions suggest that on average the factors measuring workload surge due to ARRA increase the probability a sampled agency outsources oversight by roughly 5 to 10%. Professional capacity on the other hand was not found to be a significant factor in the estimated models.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This research aims to determine soil vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in situ from the measured steady infiltration rate (I), initial soil properties and double-ring infiltrometer (DRI) test data. Characterizing the effects of these variables on the measured steady infiltration rate will enable more accurate prediction of K-s. We measured the effects of the ring diameter, head of ponding, ring depth, initial effective saturation and soil macroscopic capillary length on measured steady infiltration rates. We did this by simulating 864 DRI tests with the finite element program HYDRUS-2D and by conducting 39 full-scale in situ DRI tests, 30 Mini-Disk infiltrometer experiments and four Guelph Permeameter tests. The M5' model trees and genetic programming (GP) methods were applied to the data to establish formulae to predict the K-s of sandy to sandy-clay soils. The nine field DRI tests were used to verify the computer models. We determined the accuracy of the methods with 30% of the simulated DRI data to compare I/K-s values of the finite element models with estimates from the suggested formulae. We also used the suggested formulae to predict the K-s values of 30 field DRI experiments and compared them with values measured by Guelph Permeameter tests. Compared with the GP method, the M5' model was better at predicting K-S, with a correlation coefficient of 0.862 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.282 cm s(-1). In addition, the latter method estimated K-s values of the field experiments more accurately, with an RMSE of 0.00346 cm s(-1).",

The Hispanic population is also surprisingly understudied in previous work. In this article, we employ seven waves of data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly to examine the association between religious attendance and performance-based mobility trajectories among older Mexican Americans. Growth mixture estimates reveal three latent classes of mobility trajectories: (1) high, (2) moderate, and (3) low. Multinomial logistic regression estimates show that the odds of being classified as having low mobility (versus high and moderate mobility) are lower for respondents who attend religious services than for respondents who never attend. Religious attendance does not distinguish between moderate and high mobility. Our regression results confirm that religious attendance is associated with favorable mobility trajectories among older Mexican Americans.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Although design practitioners have a myriad of information sources available, they often have little time to evaluate the information. The need to study visual persuasive tactics is highlighted by (1) the propensity of designers to use visual communications, (2) the availability of sources that range in validity, (3) work stressors encountered by designers, and (4) the benefits of using peer-reviewed sources. Given these contexts, it may behoove design scholars to acknowledge the constraints and desires of their intended audience, which may include practicing interior designers. Framed by Petty and Cacioppo's Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion, this study's goal was to compare design practitioners' hedonic perceptions of empirical research documents. Thirty-four participants completed a mixed-method survey soliciting perceptions relative to the organizational strategies and word-to-image ratios of two document iterations. Responses ascertained from Likert-type scales, heat maps, and open-ended questions suggest that designers, at times, evaluate an information source based on the graphic quality in which it is presented. Taken together, findings from this study might provide some useful guidance for those conveying information to practitioners who are less familiar with academic literature but could benefit from the knowledge provided, thus increasing the likelihood of informed design decision-making practices. Furthermore, the methods utilized during this inquiry might serve as a pilot for future studies in this area.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Using data from 11 major international markets that celebrate six cultural New Year holidays that do not occur on January 1, we find that stock markets tend to outperform in days surrounding a cultural New Year. After controlling for firm characteristics, an average stock earns 2.5% higher abnormal returns across all markets in the month of a cultural New Year relative to other months of the year. Further evidence suggests that positive holiday moods, in conjunction with cash infusions prior to a cultural New Year, produce elevated stock prices, particularly among those stocks most preferred and traded by individual investors.",

Modified daily undulating periodization model produces greater performance than a traditional configuration in powerlifters. J Strength Cond Res 30(3): 784-791, 2016The primary aim of this study was to compare 2 daily undulating periodization (DUP) models on one-repetition maximum (1RM) strength in the squat, bench press, deadlift, total volume (TV) lifted, and temporal hormone response. Eighteen male, college-aged (21.1 +/- 1.9 years) powerlifters participated in this study and were assigned to one of 2 groups: (a) traditional DUP training with a weekly training order: hypertrophy-specific, strength-specific, and power-specific training (HSP, n = 9) or (b) modified DUP training with a weekly training order: hypertrophy-specific, power-specific, and strength-specific training (HPS, n = 9). Both groups trained 3 nonconsecutive days per week for 6 weeks and performed the squat, bench press, and deadlift exercises. During hypertrophy and power sessions, subjects performed a fixed number of sets and repetitions but performed repetitions until failure at a given percentage during strength sessions to compare TV. Testosterone and cortisol were measured at pretesting and posttesting and before each strength-specific day. Hypertrophy, power, and strength produced greater TV in squat and bench press (p 0.05) than HSP, but not for deadlift (p > 0.05). For squat and deadlift, there was no difference between groups for 1RM (p > 0.05); however, HPS exhibited greater increases in 1RM bench press than HSP (p 0.05). Effect sizes (ES) showed meaningful differences (ES > 0.50) in favor of HPS for squat and bench press 1RM. Testosterone decreased (p 0.05) at weeks 5 and 6 and cortisol decline at weeks 3 and 4. However, neither hormone was different at posttesting compared with pretesting (p > 0.05). Our findings suggest that an HPS configuration of DUP has enhanced performance benefits compared with HSP.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The solute carrier 30A (SLC30A) family of zinc exporters transports zinc into the lumen of intracellular organelles in order to prevent zinc toxicity. We reported that formation of tyrosine dimers is required for ZnT3 (zinc transporter 3) zinc transport activity and targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) in PC12 cells and the formation of ZnT3/ZnT10 heterodimers. Here, we focused on ZnT10 to determine the role of heterodimerization in the sorting of ZnTs in the endolysosomal pathway. Using cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence approaches, we found that ZnT10 resides in transferrin receptor and Rab5-positive endosomes and forms covalent heterodimers and oligomers with ZnT2, ZnT3 and ZnT4. The interaction of ZnT10 with ZnT3, mediated by dityrosine bonds, was unable to target ZnT10 into SLMVsin vitro or into synaptic vesicles isolated from mouse brain in vivo. However, ZnT3/ZnT10 heterodimers regulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) signaling by increasing the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), but not EGF-R, C-Raf or Akt phosphorylation in response to EGF. Further, mutation of tyrosine 4 in ZnT10 reduced ZnT3/ZnT10 dityrosine-mediated heterodimerization and zinc transport, as well as MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which were also reduced by the zinc chelator TPEN. Phosphorylation of these kinases is likely to occur in the cytosol as no differences in phosphorylation were observed in membrane fractions of control and ZnT3/ZnT10-expressing cells. We propose that ZnT10 plays a role in signal transduction, which is mediated by homo and heterodimerization with other ZnTs.",

Design, Setting and ParticipantsBetween August 2010 and January 2013, we conducted a 90-day daily diary study with 174 females who were in current dating relationships from a large university in the Southeastern United States. The mean age of the sample was 18.70years [standard deviation (SD)=1.27]; participants were primarily non-Hispanic Caucasian (86.2%). Participants answered questions about contact with their dating partner, being the victim of violence (physical and sexual) during a date, physical perpetration, alcohol use and cannabis use for up to 90 days. The mean number of diaries completed was 54.90 (SD=27.66). MeasurementsThe primary outcomes were self-reported daily cannabis and alcohol use. Being the victim of violence during a date was assessed each day using self-report items from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales and Sexual Experiences Survey. FindingsBeing the victim of violence during a date predicted cannabis use the following day (odds ratio=2.25), and this effect held when controlling for contact with a partner, cannabis and alcohol use the previous day, physical perpetration the previous day, alcohol use the same day and the overall likelihood of being the victim of violence during a date, substance use and physical perpetration. Being the victim of violence during a date did not predict next-day alcohol use. Being the victim of sexual and physical violence during a date did not differentially predict next-day substance use. ConclusionsAmong female college students in the United States, being the victim of violence during a date appears to increase the risk for cannabis use the following day.",

      "Abstract Note" : "OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of the folk remedy of chicken-egg membrane dressing on wound healing. DESIGN: Full-thickness excisional wounds were created on 14 male Sprague-Dawley rats in 2 separate trials. Each animal received 2 wounds on the upper back. One wound was untreated, and the other was dressed with chicken-egg membrane to assess its impact on wound healing. Half of the rats received egg membrane treatment on the inferior wound, whereas the other half received egg membrane treatment on the superior wound. Membrane replacement, wound debridement, and imaging were done on days 5, 8, and 10 and then imaging continued on days 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 of the experiment. Healing rate was measured based on the wound area over the 20 days of the experiment. RESULTS: The wounds dressed with chicken-egg membrane had a significantly (P < .01) faster rate of healing compared with the control at the early stages of healing between days 0 and 5. This group healed 21% faster during this early phase, compared with the control group. Overall, however, wound healing rates were indistinguishable from days 5 to 20. CONCLUSION: Chicken-egg membrane dressing significantly improves healing of cutaneous wounds in the early stages of wound healing.",

Biocrude yields ranged from 36 to 45 wt % (dry weight), with fast HTL with low mass loading giving the highest yield. This condition also gave the biocrude with the lowest heating value, which indicates there are compromises to be made between biocrude quantity and quality. The aqueous phase and biocrude product fractions were characterized using elemental analysis and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). This detailed level of analysis identified more than 30,000 unique molecular products. The aqueous phase products included compounds with the same molecular formulae as known herbicides, which may inform efforts in genetic engineering of algae and/or bacteria for cultivation on the aqueous phase. This detailed molecular-level characterization provides some clues regarding the types of reactions that may take place during HTL.

Although the constructs in the RDoC system are characterized in process terms (i.e., as functional concepts with brain and behavioral referents), these constructs can also be framed as dispositions (i.e., as dimensions of variation in biobehavioral functioning across individuals). Focusing on one key RDoC construct, acute threat or fear, the current article illustrates a construct-oriented psychoneurometric strategy for operationalizing this construct in individual difference termsas threat sensitivity (THT+). Utilizing data from 454 adult participants, we demonstrate empirically that (a) a scale measure of THT+ designed to tap general fear/fearlessness predicts effectively to relevant clinical problems (i.e., fear disorder symptoms), (b) this scale measure shows reliable associations with physiological indices of acute reactivity to aversive visual stimuli, and (c) a cross-domain factor reflecting the intersection of scale and physiological indicators of THT+ predicts effectively to both clinical and neurophysiological criterion measures. Results illustrate how the psychoneurometric approach can be used to create a dimensional index of a biobehavioral trait construct, in this case THT+, which can serve as a bridge between phenomena in domains of psychopathology and neurobiology. Implications and future directions are discussed with reference to the RDoC initiative and existing report-based conceptions of psychological traits.",

      "Abstract Note" : "As highlighted by articles in the current special issue, the RDoC initiative holds promise for advancing understanding of mental health problems. However, the initiative is at its early stages and it remains unclear what level of progress can be achieved and how quickly. In this closing article, we identify major challenges facing RDoC and propose concrete approaches to addressing these challenges, including (a) clearer specification of clinical problems for study, with use of symptom dimensions from integrative dimensional models of psychopathology as provisional, modifiable referents; (b) encouragement of research on a distinct set of traits corresponding to process constructs from the RDoC matrixthose represented across animal, child temperament, and adult personality literaturesto serve as interfaces between matrix constructs and clinical problems; (c) an emphasis in the near term on use of proximal units of analysis in RDoC studiesin particular, on physiological, behavioral, and self-report measures of matrix constructs (examined as states or traits, or both); (d) inclusion of a clear ontogenetic-developmental component in RDoC research projects; (e) routine analysis of the psychometric properties of nonreport (e.g., physiological, task-behavioral) variables, including systematic evaluation of their reliability and convergent-discriminant validity; (f) modification of existing grant review criteria to prioritize replication and synergy in RDoC investigative work; and (g) creation of a cumulative data network system (RDoC-DataWeb) to encourage and facilitate coordination of research efforts across RDoC research groups.",

However, there is much to be learned about how students enter into and sustain their engagement in these practices. In this paper, we argue that epistemic affectfeelings and emotions experienced within science, such as the excitement of having a new idea or irritation at an inconsistencyis part of what instigates and stabilizes disciplinary engagement. We first discuss affect as evident in accounts of professionals; we then show its emergence and role in 2 case studies of elementary school students. In the end, we argue that epistemic affect is part of the substance that students should learn in science, and we discuss implications for research and instruction.

      "Abstract Note" : "The emergence of exceptionally diverse clades is often attributed to ecological opportunity. For example, the exceptional diversity in the most diverse superfamily of mammals, muroid rodents, has been explained in terms of multiple independent adaptive radiations. If multiple ecological opportunity events are responsible for generating muroid diversity, we expect to find evidence of these lineages ecologically diversifying following dispersal into new biogeographical areas. In the present study, we tested the trait-based predictions of ecological opportunity using data on body size, appendages, and elevation in combination with previously published data on biogeographical transitions and a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. We identified weak to no support of early ecological diversification following the initial colonizations of all continental regions, based on multiple tests, including node height tests, disparity through time plots, evolutionary model comparison, and Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures. Clades identified with increased diversification rates, not associated with geographical transitions, also did not show patterns of phenotypic divergence predicted by ecological opportunity, which suggests that phylogenetic diversity and phenotypic disparity may be decoupled in muroids. These results indicate that shifts in diversification rates and biogeographically-mediated ecological opportunity are poor predictors of phenotypic diversity patterns in muroids.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We report the polarization-dependent and time resolved photoluminescence (PL) properties of gold nanorods (AuNRs). AuNRs corresponding to three different length-to diameter aspect ratios (AR)-1.86, 2.91, and 3.90-were examined using single-nanorod spectroscopy and imaging; the nanorod volume was approximately constant over the three sample types. For each AuNR, an aspect ratio-independent transverse plasmon resonance (TSPR) was detected at 2.41 eV. Aspect-ratio-dependent longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were observed at 2.08 +/- 0.19 eV, 1.76 +/- 0.12 eV, and 1.53 +/- 0.15 eV for the 1.86-AR, 2.91-AR, and 3.90-AR samples, respectively. On the basis of both excitation and emission polarization-resolved two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) measurements, AuNR PL emission proceeded by plasmon-mediated radiative electron hole recombination. The resonant LSPR mode frequencies of the nanorods were determined from interferometrically detected TPPL signals. For these measurements, the interpulse time delays of a spectrally broad laser pulse (1.48-1.65 eV) were changed systematically with attosecond time resolution, and the TPPL signal amplitude was recorded. The 1.86-AR AuNR did not support a plasmon mode that was resonant within the laser bandwidth, whereas the 2.91-AR and 3.90-AR samples had LSPR frequencies that overlapped the high- and low-energy components of the excitation pulse. The LSPR frequencies were obtained by Fourier transformation of the time-domain TPPL data and compared to dark-field scattering spectra. The accuracy of the interferometric TPPL measurement for recovering plasmon resonance frequencies was confirmed by polarization-dependent measurements; alignment of the laser electric field parallel to the nanorod major axis was LSPR resonant, whereas projection of the laser pulse into an orthogonal plane was not. Finally, dephasing times (T-2) for resonant plasmon modes were extracted from analysis of interferometric TPPL and second harmonic generation data. These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 +/- 4 to 31 +/- 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon dephasing due to interband scattering for lower energy resonances. These results demonstrate the capability of interferometric nonlinear optical imaging with single-nanostructure sensitivity for determining structure-specific dephasing times, which influence the efficiency of metal nanoparticle light-harvesting applications. Therefore, interferometric nonlinear optical (NLO) imaging is likely to make a significant impact on the rational design of photonic nanostructures.",

Here we introduce microenvironmental selective plane illumination microscopy (meSPIM) for imaging and quantification of intracellular signaling and submicrometer cellular structures as well as large-scale cell morphological and environmental features. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment regulate the transition of melanoma cells from actin-driven protrusion to blebbing, and we present tools to quantify how cells manipulate individual collagen fibers. We leverage the nearly isotropic resolution of meSPIM to quantify the local concentration of actin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling on the surfaces of cells deep within 3D collagen matrices and track the many small membrane protrusions that appear in these more physiologically relevant environments.",

The electronic ground state of the Au-25(SC8H9)(18) MPC is described by an eight-electron P-like superatom orbital. Hot electron relaxation (200 +/- 15 fs) within the superatom D manifold of lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals was resolved from hot hole relaxation (290 +/- 20 fs) in the superatom P states by using 2DES in a partially collinear pump probe geometry. Electronic relaxation dynamics mediated by specific superatom states were distinguished by examining the time-dependent cross-peak amplitudes for specific excitation and detection photon energy combinations. Quantification of the time dependent amplitudes and energy positions of cross peaks in the 2.21/1.85 eV (excitation/detection) region confirmed that an apparent energetic blue shift observed for transient bleach signals results from rapid hot electron relaxation in the superatom D states. The combination of structurally precise MPCs and state-resolved 2DES can be used to examine directly the influence of nanoscale structural modifications on electronic carrier dynamics, which are critical for developing nanocluster-based photonic devices.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Synthesizing nanomaterials of uniform shape and size is of critical importance to access and manipulate the novel structure property relationships arising at the nanoscale, such as catalytic activity. In this work, we synthesize Pd nanoparticles with well-controlled size in the sub-3 nm range using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in combination with an in situ liquid stage. We use an aromatic hydrocarbon (toluene) as a solvent that is very resistant to high-energy electron irradiation, which creates a net reducing environment without the need for additives to scavenge oxidizing radicals. The primary reducing species is molecular hydrogen, which is a widely used reductant in the synthesis of supported metal catalysts. We propose a mechanism of particle formation based on the effect of tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) on size stabilization, relatively low production of radicals, and autocatalytic reduction of Pd(II) compounds. We combine in situ STEM results with insights from in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) from alcohol-based synthesis, having similar reduction potential, in a customized microfluidic device as well as ex situ bulk experiments. This has allowed us to develop a fundamental growth model for the synthesis of size-stabilized Pd nanoparticles and demonstrate the utility of correlating different in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to understand, and ultimately control, metal nanostructure synthesis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Rimantadine hydrochloride (alpha-methyl-1-adamantane-methalamine hydrochloride) is a chiral compound which exerts antiviral activity against the influenza A virus by inhibiting proton conductance of the M2 ion channel. In complex with M2, rimantadine has always been characterized as a racemic mixture. Here, we report the novel enantioselective synthesis of deuterium labeled (R)- and (S)-rimantadine and the characterization of their protein ligand interactions using solid-state NMR. Isotropic chemical shift changes strongly support differential binding of the enantiomers to the proton channel. Position restrained simulations satisfying distance restraints from C-13-H-2 rotational-echo double-resonance NMR show marked differences in the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the two enantiomers at the binding site. Together these results suggest a complex set of interactions between (R)-rimantadine and the M2 proton channel, leading to a higher stability for this enantiomer of the drug in the channel pore.",

Interaction of an RNA duplex representing the branch site helix perturbed at least 10 nuclear magnetic resonance cross-peaks of N-15-labeled p14. However, similar chemical shift changes were observed upon interaction with a duplex without the bulged branch site residue, suggesting that binding of p14 to RNA is nonspecific and does not recognize the branch site. We propose that the p14 RNA interaction screens charges on the backbone of the branch site during spliceosome assembly.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Metabolism in islet beta-cells displays oscillations that can trigger pulses of electrical activity and insulin secretion. There has been a decades-long debate among islet biologists about whether metabolic oscillations are intrinsic or occur in response to oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ that result from bursting electrical activity. In this article, the dynamics of oscillatory metabolism were investigated using five different optical reporters. Reporter activity was measured simultaneously with membrane potential bursting to determine the phase relationships between the metabolic oscillations and electrical activity. Our experimental findings suggest that Ca2+ entry into beta-cells stimulates the rate of mitochondrial metabolism, accounting for the depletion of glycolytic intermediates during each oscillatory burst. We also performed Ca2+ clamp tests in which we clamped membrane potential with the K-ATP channel-opener diazoxide and KCl to fix Ca2+ at an elevated level. These tests confirm that metabolic oscillations do not require Ca2+ oscillations, but show that Ca2+ plays a larger role in shaping metabolic oscillations than previously suspected. A dynamical picture of the mechanisms of oscillations emerged that requires the restructuring of contemporary mathematical beta-cell models, including our own dual oscillator model. In the companion article, we modified our model to account for these new data.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Pancreatic islets respond to elevated blood glucose by secreting pulses of insulin that parallel oscillations in beta-cell metabolism, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and bursting electrical activity. The mechanisms that maintain an oscillatory response are not fully understood, yet several models have been proposed. Only some can account for experiments supporting that metabolism is intrinsically oscillatory in beta-cells. The dual oscillator model (DOM) implicates glycolysis as the source of oscillatory metabolism. In the companion article, we use recently developed biosensors to confirm that glycolysis is oscillatory and further elucidate the coordination of metabolic and electrical signals in the insulin secretory pathway. In this report, we modify the DOM by incorporating an established link between metabolism and intracellular Ca2+ to reconcile model predictions with experimental observations from the companion article. With modification, we maintain the distinguishing feature of the DOM, oscillatory glycolysis, but introduce the ability of Ca2+ influx to reshape glycolytic oscillations by promoting glycolytic efflux. We use the modified model to explain measurements from the companion article and from previously published experiments with islets.",

Methods: Case-control study: each of the 12 residents functioned as their own control. Additionally, aggregate data from the programme was reviewed. Results: Twelve residents from a mid-sized OBGYN residency programme performed a standardised patient clinical encounter exercise in March of 2014. As demonstrated by the Assessment for Professional Behavior (APB) 360 degrees evaluation, the overall total scores for the programme on patient advocacy improved, with statistical significance, when analysed by the signed ranked test. Additionally, the residents' self-identified capability to perform advocacy improved after the programme, with statistical significance, when analysed by the signed rank test. Conclusions: A standardised patient clinical encounter, used as a learning exercise, can demonstrate meaningful improvement in the advocacy skills of a resident doctor.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the perceived eHealth literacy of a general health consumer population so that healthcare professionals can effectively address skills gaps in health consumers' ability to access and use high-quality online health information. Participants were recruited from three public library branches in a Northeast Florida community. The eHealth Literacy Scale was used. The majority of participants (n = 108) reported they knew how and where to find health information and how to use it to make health decisions; knowledge of what health resources were available and confidence in the ability to distinguish high-from low-quality information were considerably less. The findings suggest the need for eHealth education and support to health consumers from healthcare professionals, in particular, how to access and evaluate the quality of health information.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose of the Study: Combat is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, less is known about how exposure to combat in early adulthood may contribute to the development of PTSD as the individual ages. Prior exposure to trauma may \"sensitize\" people to respond more intensely to subsequent stressors. Further, aging initiates new challenges that may undermine previous coping strategies. Over the life course combat veterans may be more reactive to new stressors and thus be more vulnerable to PTSD. Design and Methods: This study draws on the two waves of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-1) and NCS-2 (10-year follow-up). Participants were male (noncombat N = 620 and combat N = 107) and 50-65 years of age at Wave-2. At baseline, participants were assessed for exposure to wartime combat, number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnoses in the past year, and life-time PTSD. At follow-up, PTSD occurring between waves was determined. A measure of recent life stressors was also obtained. Results: Using logistic regression analyses, combat predicted PTSD at follow-up (controlling for baseline demographics, number of DSM diagnoses in the past year, life-time PTSD). Recent life stressors were also associated with PTSD. Importantly, the effect of combat on PTSD was significant at high levels, but not low levels, of recent life stress. Implications: Veterans who have experienced combat may be more reactive to new stressors, and in turn be more vulnerable to PTSD. Combat veterans should be regularly assessed for current stressors and PTSD.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Purpose of the Study: We examined the association of military service-related exposures (SREs) with physical health trajectories to establish whether combat and other hazards have lasting connections to health in later life. We also examined potential confounders and mechanisms to further understand the associations. Design and Methods: We used the 2013 HRS Veterans Mail Survey linked to the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine military service experiences and health over a decade (2000-2010) among veteran men. We employed latent class analysis to disaggregate trajectories of health in later life. Results: Most veteran men experienced good health over the decade. Although we found a connection between combat and later health, it was driven primarily by hazardous or traumatic exposures. Service-related disability, current health behaviors, and mental health were not likely explanations for these associations. Implications: The measurement of service experiences is primary in understanding health implications of military service and projecting the health service needs of aging veterans. SREs are varied and complex and have differential connections to health. These connections remain unexplained by current behaviors and mental health, suggesting the need to examine earlier life course pathways and mechanisms.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The problem of family homelessness has been widely recognized by both policymakers and social service providers. What is not clear, however, is the overall effectiveness of housing intervention services provided to homeless families. This narrative review of the literature discusses 10 studies from 1991 to 2013 on both transitional and supportive housing in order to assess under what conditions and for whom these interventions are most effective. More specifically this review evaluates the research regarding which elements of intervention services are most helpful to families, the outcomes associated with these programmes, and the short-and long-term effectiveness of housing interventions. Evidence suggests that while these programmes produce positive outcomes for families, a one-size-fits-all model of housing may not be effective for all families. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Sugars promote lateral root formation at low levels but become inhibitory at high C/N or C/P ratios. How sugars suppress lateral root formation is unclear, however. Here we report that WOX7, a member of the WUSCHEL related homeobox (WOX) family transcription factors, inhibits lateral root development in a sugar-dependent manner. The number of lateral root primordia increased in wox7 mutants but decreased in plants over-expressing WOX7. Plants expressing the WOX7-VP16 fusion protein produced even more lateral roots than wox7, suggesting that WOX7 acts as a transcriptional repressor in lateral root development. WOX7 is expressed at all stages of lateral root development, but it is primarily involved in lateral root initiation. Consistent with this, the wox7 mutant had a higher mitotic activity only at early stages of lateral root development. Further studies suggest that WOX7 regulates lateral root development through direct repression of cell cycle genes, particularly CYCD6;1. WOX7 expression was enhanced by sugar, reduced by auxin, but did not respond to salt and mannitol. In the wox7 mutant, the effect of sugar on lateral root formation was mitigated. These results together suggest that WOX7 plays an important role in coupling the lateral root development program and sugar status in plants.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Optical ruler methods employing multiple fluorescent labels offer great potential for correlating distances among several sites, but are generally limited to interlabel distances under 10 nm and suffer from complications due to spectral overlap. Here we demonstrate a multicolor surface energy transfer (McSET) technique able to triangulate multiple points on a biopolymer, allowing for analysis of global structure in complex biomolecules. McSET couples the competitive energy transfer pathways of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) with gold-nanoparticle mediated Surface Energy Transfer (SET) in order to correlate systematically labeled points on the structure at distances greater than 10 nm and with reduced spectral overlap. To demonstrate the McSET method, the structures of a linear B-DNA and a more complex folded RNA ribozyme were analyzed within the McSET mathematical framework. The improved multicolor optical ruler method takes advantage of the broad spectral range and distances achievable when using a gold nanoparticle as the lowest energy acceptor. The ability to report distance information simultaneously across multiple length scales, short-range (10-50 angstrom), mid-range (50-150 angstrom), and long-range (150-350 angstrom), distinguishes this approach from other multicolor energy transfer methods.",

      "Abstract Note" : "OBJECTIVE: Identifying racial and ethnic differences in perceived need for treatment among families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will improve understanding of disparities in care seeking. We described racial and ethnic differences in perceived need for services that children with ASD and their families frequently use. METHODS: We conducted bivariate analyses of racial and ethnic categories and perceived need for 6 common services used by children with ASD as found in the 2005 to 2006 (n = 2123) and the 2009 to 2010 (n = 3055) National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs data sets. Multivariate logistic regressions within concatenated data sets were conducted to examine associations between racial and ethnic category and perceived service needs while controlling for predisposing, enabling, and child factors. RESULTS: Compared with caregivers of white non-Hispanic children with ASD, caregivers of Hispanic children reported less need for prescription medications in adjusted multivariate analyses. Caregivers of black non-Hispanic children with ASD reported less need for prescription medications and for child and family mental health services than caregivers of white non-Hispanic children. Both English-speaking Hispanic caregivers and black non-Hispanic caregivers reported greater need for occupational, speech, and physical therapy than white non-Hispanic caregivers. No racial or ethnic differences were found in perceived need for specialty medical care or respite care. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of children with ASD from different racial and ethnic backgrounds may differentially perceive need for different types of care. Their perceptions may in turn affect how they prioritize and seek care, independent of their child's specific needs.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A cross-sectional design based on the family ecosystem framework was used to examine how students' time spent engaging in social interactions and personal behaviours was related to dating, stress and satisfaction with life. The data were extracted from the Parental Indulgence of Emerging Adults study and consisted of 534 students at a southeastern university. The findings indicated that the amount of time involved in non-verbal social interactions, such as texting and social networking, along with solitary activities, such as watching TV and studying, was negatively related to students' life satisfaction. In comparison, being in a relationship and talking to people on the phone were positively related to students' life satisfaction. These results have implications for family and health professionals along with university wellness centres that facilitate student health by incorporating preventative measures to help students deal with their stress.

A similar to 20-fold increase in the pairwise selectivity was observed following a reduction treatment of the Ir/TiO2 catalyst at 500 degrees C. Consistent with SMSI, the effects could be completely reversed by oxidation followed by rereduction at 200 degrees C. Noninteracting supports, such as Al2O3 and SiO2, did not show this behavior. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals partial reduction of the TiO2 support, and STEM data reveal flattening of Ir particles after high-temperature reduction. The presence of chloride ions during activation was found to further promote pairwise selectivity but only for the Ir/TiO2 catalyst. The results are interpreted in terms of the electronic and possible geometric blocking effects associated with SMSI.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The aim of this work was to determine and understand the origin of the electronic properties of Mn-IV complexes, especially the zero-field splitting (ZFS), through a combined experimental and theoretical investigation on five well-characterized mononuclear octahedral Mn-IV compounds, with various coordination spheres (N-6, N3O3, N2O4 in both trans (trans-N2O4) and cis configurations (cis-N2O4) and O4S2). High-frequency and -field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy has been applied to determine the ZFS parameters of two of MnLtrans-N2O4 and Mn(LO4S)2 these compounds,. While at X-band EPR, the axial-component of the ZFS tensor, D, was estimated to be +0.47 cm(-1) for MnLO4S2, and a D-value of +2.289(5) cm(-1) was determined by HFEPR, which is the largest D-magnitude ever measured for a Mn-IV complex. A moderate D value of -0.997(6) cm(-1) has been found for MnLtrans-N2O4. Quantum chemical calculations based on two theoretical frameworks (the Density Functional Theory based on a coupled perturbed approach (CP-DFT) and the hybrid Ligand-Field DFT (LF-DFT)) have been performed to define appropriate methodologies to calculate the ZFS tensor for Mn-IV centers, to predict the orientation of the magnetic axes with respect to the molecular ones, and to define and quantify the physical origin of the different contributions to the ZFS. Except in the case of MnLtrans-N2O4, the experimental and calculated D values are in good agreement, and the sign of D is well predicted, LF-DFT being more satisfactory than CP-DFT. The calculations performed on MnLcis-N2O4 are consistent with the orientation of the principal anisotropic axis determined by single-crystal EPR, validating the calculated ZFS tensor orientation. The different contributions to D were analyzed demonstrating that the d-d transitions mainly govern D in Mn-IV ion. However, a deep analysis evidences that many factors enter into the game, explaining why no obvious magnetostructural correlations can be drawn in this series of Mn-IV complexes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Evolutionary theory predicts that divergent selection pressures across elevational gradients could cause adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation in the process of ecological speciation. Although there is substantial evidence for adaptive divergence across elevation, there is less evidence that this restricts gene flow. Previous work in the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) has demonstrated adaptive divergence in morphological, life history and physiological traits across an elevational gradient from approximately 1500-3000m in the Colorado Front Range, USA. We tested whether this adaptive divergence is associated with restricted gene flow across elevation - as would be expected if incipient speciation were occurring - and, if so, whether behavioural isolation contributes to reproductive isolation. Our analysis of 12 microsatellite loci in 797 frogs from 53 populations revealed restricted gene flow across elevation, even after controlling for geographic distance and topography. Calls also varied significantly across elevation in dominant frequency, pulse number and pulse duration, which was partly, but not entirely, due to variation in body size and temperature across elevation. However, call variation did not result in strong behavioural isolation: in phonotaxis experiments, low-elevation females tended to prefer an average low-elevation call over a high-elevation call, and vice versa for high-elevation females, but this trend was not statistically significant. In summary, our results show that adaptive divergence across elevation restricts gene flow in P. maculata, but the mechanisms for this potential incipient speciation remain open.",

The purpose of this study was to establish the link between social/psychological predictor variables and suicidal ideation by testing a hypothesized minority stress model. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relationships posited in the model using data from a community sample of 167 gay men. Model fit was adequate and hypothesized relationships were partially supported. Also, depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship between (less) outness predicting suicidal ideation. These findings imply that therapeutic approaches targeting the coming out process may be more effective than approaches targeting internalized homophobia when suicidal ideation is indicated in the clinical presentation of gay and bisexual men.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To slow the rate of global species loss, it is imperative to understand how to restore and maintain native biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial heterogeneity and turnover in community composition (-diversity). While some techniques are known to enhance -diversity, it is unclear whether habitat restoration can re-establish -diversity. Using a long-term pollinator dataset, comprising approximate to 9,800 specimens collected from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central Valley of California, we show that on-farm habitat restoration in the form of native plant hedgerows', when replicated across a landscape, can boost -diversity by approximately 14% relative to unrestored field margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows restore -diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological filter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small-scale restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides arising from strong spin-orbit interactions and valley-dependent Berry curvature effects have recently attracted considerable interest(1-7). Although single-particle and excitonic phenomena related to spin-valley coupling have been extensively studied(1,3-6), the effects of spin-valley coupling on collective quantum phenomena remain less well understood. Here we report the observation of superconducting monolayer NbSe2 with an in-plane upper critical field of more than six times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, by means of magnetotransport measurements. The effect can be interpreted in terms of the competing Zeeman effect and large intrinsic spin-orbit interactions in non-centrosymmetric NbSe2 monolayers, where the electron spin is locked to the out-of-plane direction. Our results provide strong evidence of unconventional Ising pairing protected by spin-momentum locking, and suggest further studies of non-centrosymmetric superconductivity with unique spin and valley degrees of freedom in the two-dimensional limit.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The genetic diversity and phylogeography of maternal lineages in Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758 (the brown bear) have been studied extensively over the last two decades; however, sampling has largely been limited to the northern Holarctic, and was possibly biased towards lineages that recolonized the vast expanses of the north as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ended. Here we report the genetic diversity and phylogeography of U.arctos from Turkey based on 35 non-invasive samples, including five from captive individuals. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses based on a 269-bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region revealed 14 novel haplotypes belonging to three major lineages. The most widespread lineage was found to be the Eastern clade3a, whereas geographically more restricted Western and Middle Eastern lineages were reported for the first time in Turkey. A specimen from the Taurus mountain range carried a haplotype closely related to the presumably extinct bears in Lebanon. Moreover, we identify a unique new lineage that appears to have split early within the Middle Eastern clade. Despite limited sampling, our study reveals a high level of mitochondrial diversity in Turkish U.arctos, shows that the ranges of both European and Middle Eastern clades extend into Turkey, and identifies a new divergent lineage of possibly wider historical occurrence. Obtaining these results with 35 samples also demonstrates the value of proper sampling from regions that have not been significantly affected by the LGM.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London",

      "Abstract Note" : "High magnetic fields expand our capability to use sodium MRI for biomedical applications. The central goal of this review is devoted to the unique features of sodium MRI in tumor animal models, mainly in glioma, performed at 9.4 and 21.1T. The ability of sodium MRI to monitor tumor response to therapy was evaluated. It is noteworthy that sodium MRI can detect glioma response to chemotherapy earlier than diffusion MRI. Especially attractive is the ability of sodium MRI to predict tumor therapeutic resistance before therapy. The non-invasive prediction of tumor chemo-resistance by sodium MRI presents a potential to individualize strategies for cancer treatment. Specifics of sodium MRI and technical aspects of imaging are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The present research sought to (a) replicate these associations in a young adult sample, (b) examine whether sex, race, or ethnicity moderate these associations, and (c) test whether personality is associated with the subjective experience of body weight and discrepancies between perceived and actual weight. Participants (N=15,669; M-age=29; 53% female; approximate to 40% ethnic/racial minority) from Wave 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health completed a Five-Factor Model personality measure and reported their weight, height, and perception of weight category (e.g., overweight); trained staff measured participants' height, weight, and waist circumference. Conscientiousness was associated with healthier weight, with a nearly 5kg difference between the top and bottom quartiles. Neuroticism among women and Extraversion among men were associated with higher adiposity. Neuroticism was also associated with misperceived heavier weight, whereas Extraversion was associated with misperceived taller and leaner. The associations were similar across race/ethnic groups. Personality is associated with objective and subjective adiposity in young adulthood. Although modest, the effects are consistent with life span theories of personality, and the misperceptions are consistent with the conceptual worldviews associated with the traits.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Driving forces for association between oppositely charged biological or synthetic polymers in aqueous solution have long been identified as electrostatic in origin. This attraction is broken down into an entropic component, due to loss of counterions, and an enthalpic component, stemming from Coulombic attraction between opposite charges. While the balance between entropic and enthalpic contributions shifts according to the conditions, the presence of exotherms or endotherms on mixing, though small, are viewed as signatures of Coulombic interactions which support theories of polyelectrolyte association rooted in continuum electrostatics. Here, a head-to-head comparison is made between mechanisms based on electrostatics and those based on specific ion pairing, or ion exchange. Using a Hofmeister series of counterions for a common polycation, poly(diallyldimethylammonium), enthalpy changes on association with poly(styrenesulfonate) are shown to derive from changes in water perturbation, revealed by Raman scattering studies of water O-H vibrations. The free energy for complexation is almost completely entropic over all salt concentrations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The dynamic self-organization of lipids in biological systems is a highly regulated process that enables the compartmentalization of living systems at micro-and nanoscopic scales. Consequently, quantitative methods for assaying the kinetics of supramolecular remodeling such as vesicle formation from planar lipid bilayers or multilayers are needed to understand cellular self-organization. Here, a new nanotechnology-based method for quantitative measurements of lipid-protein interactions is presented and its suitability for quantifying the membrane binding, inflation, and budding activity of the membrane-remodeling protein Sar1 is demonstrated. Lipid multilayer gratings are printed onto surfaces using nanointaglio and exposed to Sar1, resulting in the inflation of lipid multilayers into unilamellar structures, which can be observed in a label-free manner by monitoring the diffracted light. Local variations in lipid multilayer volume on the surface is used to vary substrate availability in a microarray format. A quantitative model is developed that allows quantification of binding affinity (K-D) and kinetics (k(on) and k(off)). Importantly, this assay is uniquely capable of quantifying membrane remodeling. Upon Sar1-induced inflation of single bilayers from surface supported multilayers, the semicylindrical grating lines are observed to remodel into semispherical buds when a critical radius of curvature is reached.",

      "Abstract Note" : "DNA replication is temporally and spatially organized in all eukaryotes, yet the molecular control and biological function of the replication-timing program are unclear. Rif1 is required for normal genome-wide regulation of replication timing, but its molecular function is poorly understood. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells, Rif1 coats late-replicating domains and, with Lamin B1, identifies most of the late-replicating genome. Rif1 is an essential determinant of replication timing of non-Lamin B1-bound late domains. We further demonstrate that Rif1 defines and restricts the interactions between replication-timing domains during the G1 phase, thereby revealing a function of Rif1 as organizer of nuclear architecture. Rif1 loss affects both number and replication-timing specificity of the interactions between replication-timing domains. In addition, during the S phase, Rif1 ensures that replication of interacting domains is temporally coordinated. In summary, our study identifies Rif1 as the molecular link between nuclear architecture and replication-timing establishment in mammals.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Spaceflight has profound effects on vascular function as a result of weightlessness that may be further compounded by radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study was to assess the individual and combined effects of hindlimb unloading (HU) and radiation (Rad) on vasodilator responses in the skeletal muscle vasculature. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to one of four groups: control (Con), HU (tail suspension for 15 days), Rad (200 cGy of Cs-137), and HU-Rad (15-day tail suspension and 200 cGy of Cs-137). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of gastrocnemius feed arteries was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine (ACh, 10(-9)-10(-4) M) and inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX). Endotheliumin-dependent vasodilation was assessed using Dea-NONOate (10(-9)-10(-4) M). Endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilator responses were impaired relative to Con responses in all treatment groups; however, there was no further impairment from the combination of treatments (HU-Rad) relative to that in the HU and Rad groups. The NOS-mediated contribution to endothelium-dependent vasodilation was depressed with HU and Rad. This impairment in NOS signaling may have been partially compensated for by an enhancement of PGI(2)-mediated dilation. Changes in endothelium-dependent vasodilation were also associated with decrements in trabecular bone volume in the proximal tibia metaphysis. These data demonstrate that the simulated space environment (i.e., radiation exposure and unloading of muscle and bone) significantly impairs skeletal muscle artery vasodilation, mediated through endothelium-dependent reductions in NOS signaling and decrements in vascular smooth muscle cell responsiveness to NO.",

      "Abstract Note" : "It is known that the ion collision cross section (CCS) may be calculated from the linewidth of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectral peak at elevated pressure (e.g., similar to 10(-6) Torr). However, the high mass resolution of FT-ICR is sacrificed in those experiments due to high buffer gas pressure. In this study, we describe a linewidth correction method to eliminate the windowing-induced peak broadening effect. Together with the energetic ion-neutral collision model previously developed by our group, this method enables the extraction of CCSs of biomolecules from high-resolution FT-ICR mass spectral linewidths, obtained at a typical operating buffer gas pressure of modern FT-ICR instruments (similar to 10(-10) Torr). CCS values of peptides including MRFA, angiotensin I, and bradykinin measured by the proposed method agree well with ion mobility measurements, and the unfolding of protein ions (ubiquitin) at higher charge states is also observed.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A facile approach using click chemistry is demonstrated for immobilization of metalloporphyrins onto the surface of silica-coated iron oxide particles. Oleic-acid stabilized iron oxide nanocrystals were prepared by thermal decomposition of iron(III) acetylacetonate. Their crystallinity, morphology, and superparamagnetism were determined using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and a superconducting quantum interference device. Monodisperse coreshell particles were produced in the silica-coating of iron oxide via microemulsion synthesis. Surface modification of these particles was performed in two steps, which included the reaction of silica-coated iron oxide particles with 3-bromopropyltrichlorosilane, followed by azido-functionalization with sodium azide. Monoalkylated porphyrins were prepared using the Williamson ether synthesis of commercially available tetra(4-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin with propargyl bromide in the presence of a base. 1H NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization confirmed the identity of the compounds. The prepared monoalkyne porphyrins were zinc-metalated prior to their introduction to azide-functionalized, silica-coated iron oxide particles in the click reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the surface chemistry after each step in the reaction. In addition, particle size was determined using dynamic light scattering and microscopy. The presented methodology is versatile and can be extended to other photoreactive systems, such as phthalocyanines and boron-dipyrromethane, which may lead to new materials for optical, photonic, and biological applications.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Giant magnetic anisotropy\" is a phenomenon identified fairly recently in coordination complexes of nd-and nf-block ions. It can have different origins but is commonly (if not always correctly) described through zero-field splitting (ZFS), which can reach values of 100 cm(-1) and beyond. This magnitude of an-isotropy imparts on some of the complexes in question properties akin to single-ion magnets (SIMs). As a parameter of great importance, it needs to be accurately measured, a process that is far from being trivial. In this perspective article we give an overview and brief characterisation of the many experimental methods employed to that purpose, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Activation of angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling during aging increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to vascular senescence, a process linked to the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Consumption of fruits and vegetables, particularly berries, is associated with decreased incidence of CVD, which has mainly been attributed to the polyphenol content of these foods. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of blackberry (BL), raspberry (RB), and black raspberry (BRB) polyphenol extracts in attenuating Ang II-induced senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and to determine the molecular mechanisms involved. BL, RB and BRB polyphenol extracts (200 mu g ml(-1)) attenuated Ang II-induced senescence, denoted by decreased number of cells positive for senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) and down-regulation of p21 and p53 expression, which were associated with decreased ROS levels and Ang II signaling. BL polyphenol extract increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 expression, attenuated the up-regulation of Nox1 expression and the phosphorylation of Akt, p38MAPK and ERK1/2 induced by Ang II, and reduced senescence in response to Nox1 overexpression. In contrast, RB and BRB polyphenol extracts up-regulated the expression of SOD1, SOD2, and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), but exerted no effect on Nox1 expression nor on senescence induced by Nox1 overexpression. BRB reduced signaling similar to BL, while RB was unable to reduce Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of Akt, p38MAPK and ERK1/2 as well as down-regulation of Nox1 by siRNA prevented senescence induced by Ang II. Our findings indicate that Ang II-induced senescence is attenuated by BL polyphenols through a Nox1-dependent mechanism and by RB and BRB polyphenols in a Nox1-independent manner, likely by increasing the cellular antioxidant capacity.",

Here in this work, by increasing the reaction temperature to 250 degrees C, a new potassium uranyl borate K[(UO2)B6O10(OH)] (KUBO-4) framework compound is synthesized that shares the same layer topology with the previously reported 2D layered KUBO-1. The 3D structure of KUBO-4 is achieved by interlayer hydroborate condensation. The KUBO-4 was further characterized with single crystal XRD, SHG and fluorescence spectra, and TG/DSC measurements. A deep understanding regarding the dissolution behaviours of uranyl borate is achieved via solubility studies of the KUBO-1 and KUBO-4 performed using a combination of ICP-MS, powder XRD, and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The results confirm the lack of stability of borates in aqueous solutions with the presence of coordinating ligands in the environment regardless of the structure types.",

The ligand is prepared via a one-step nucleophilic addition reaction between poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) and amine-modified anchoring groups and hydrophilic moieties. Surface functionalization of gold nanoparticles and nanorods with this polymer yields nanocrystals that exhibit excellent long-term colloidal stability over a broad range of conditions, including pH changes and in growth media, as verified using dynamic light scattering measurements combined with agarose gel electrophoresis. This polymer coating can also prevent the formation of protein corona. These features bode well for use in biological applications where small size, reduced nonspecific interactions and colloidal stability are highly desired. Furthermore, this design can be easily expanded to functionalize a variety of other inorganic nanocrystals.",

      "Abstract Note" : "SiCf/BNNTs-SiC hierarchical composites were fabricated via firstly in situ growth of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) on the surface of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers using boron powder as a raw material and subsequently matrix densification by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) and polymer impregnation/pyrolysis (PIP) methods. With the incorporation of BNNTs, energy dissipation mechanisms at the nanoscale triggered by BNNTs such as pullout, debonding, crack deflection and crack bridging are observed. But the positive effect of BNNTs on mechanical properties have not been raised due to the offset from the negative effect of pores in composites. Additionally, the residual boron powder results in an improved oxidation resistance and parabolic oxidation kinetics of SiCf/SiC composites at 900 degrees C, thanks to the protective effect of the B2O3 glassy phase formed by the oxidation of boron. Consequently, a better strength retention after oxidation is obtained. Moreover, it is believed that the remaining strengthening and toughening mechanisms aroused by BNNTs surviving after oxidation probably also make a contribution to the better strength retention.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In this article we investigate the possibility to use scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) for the 2-D and 3-D \"atomistic\" dopant profiling of semiconductor materials. For this purpose, we first analyze the effects of random dopant fluctuations (RDF) on SCM measurements with nanoscale probes and show that the discrete and random locations of dopant impurities significantly affect the differential capacitance measured in SCM experiments if the dimension of the probe is below 50 nm. Then, we present an algorithm to compute the x, y, and z coordinates of the ionized impurities in the semiconductor material using a set of SCM measurements. The algorithm is based on evaluating the doping sensitivity functions of the differential capacitance and uses a gradient-based iterative method to compute the locations of dopants. Finally, we discuss a standard simulation case and show that we are able to successfully retrieve the locations of the ionized impurities using the proposed algorithm.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In his Paraphrases on the synoptic gospels, Erasmus stages the voice of the evangelist speaking in the first-person singular to address the reader in the second-person singular. Such a marked interlocutorial setting is absent in Scripture, with the exception of Luke's brief address to a certain Theophilus. More than a strategy to forestall criticisms directed at the author of the paraphrase, this direct engagement between biblical author and reader reveals a deeper concern for the transfer of gospel faith and gospel philosophy to the minds of his contemporaries. This essay examines the ways in which the evangelist's voice engages the implied reader in the Paraphrases on Matthew, Luke, and most notably Mark. It focuses on the reliability (fides) of narration and narrator, the emotional, sensory, and homiletic engagement between speaking voice and reader, and the role of drama and performative elements. The paraphrastic staging of the evangelist's voice reflects each gospel's unique challenge in conveying Philosophia Christi to the reader and in the Paraphrase on Mark illustrates in particular the literary dimension of reader-oriented imitatio.",

The samples contain highly crystalline nanoparticles of the beta(CO)-(BEDT-TTF)(2)I-3 phase, confirmed by XRD. Temperature dependent resistance and magnetic susceptibility studies evidence the superconducting transition characteristics of the beta(CO)-(BEDT-TTF)(2)I-3 phase.

Diminished eye blink rates are often seen among individuals engaged in heightened concentration on a specific task that requires careful planning and attention. Indeed, overcoming one's biological instinct for survival through suicide necessitates premeditation and concentration; thus, a diminished eye blink rate may signal imminent suicidality. Aims: This article aims to spur research and clinical inquiry into the role of eye blinks as an indicator of acute suicide risk. Method: Literature relevant to the potential connection between eye blink rate and suicidality was reviewed and synthesized. Results: Anecdotal, cognitive, neurological, and conceptual support for the relationship between decreased blink rate and suicide risk is outlined. Conclusion: Given that eye blinks are a highly observable behavior, the potential clinical utility of using eye blink rate as a marker of suicide risk is immense. Research is warranted to explore the association between eye blink rate and acute suicide risk.",

The host-guest interactions between cyclodextrins and the guest molecules can be triggered by various stimulations, including temperature, light, pH, etc. In this review, we will focus on the cyclodextrin-based controlled-release systems mainly triggered by light.

      "Abstract Note" : "Key to native ion mobility/mass spectrometry is to prevent the structural denaturation of biological molecules in the gas phase. Here, we systematically assess structural changes induced in the protein ubiquitin during a trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) experiment. Our analysis shows that the extent of structural denaturation induced in ubiquitin ions is largely proportional to the amount of translational kinetic energy an ion gains from the applied electric field between two collisions with buffer gas particles. We then minimize the efficiency of the structural denaturation of ubiquitin ions in the gas phase during a TIMS experiment. The resulting \"soft\" TIMS spectra of ubiquitin are found largely identical to those observed on \"soft\" elevated-pressure ion mobility drift tubes and the corresponding calibrated cross sections are consistent with structures reported from NMR experiments for the native and A-state of ubiquitin. Thus, our analysis reveals that TIMS is useful for native ion mobility/mass spectrometry analysis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Single-walled chrysotile nanotubes [Mg3Si2O5(OH)(4)] of increasing size (up to 5004 atoms per unit cell, corresponding to a radius of 205 angstrom) have been modelled at the Density Functional level of theory. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the (n, -n) and (n, n) series present a minimum energy structure at a specific radius (88.7 and 89.6 angstrom, respectively, referring to the neutral surface), corresponding to a rolling vector of (60, -60) and (105, 105), respectively. The minima are nearly overlapped and are lower in energy than the corresponding slab of lizardite (the flat-layered polymorph of chrysotile) by about 3.5 kJ mol(-1) per formula unit. In both cases, the energy profile presents a shallow minimum, where radii in the range of 63 to 139 angstrom differ in energy by less than 0.5 kJ mol(-1) per formula unit. The energy of larger nanotubes has a trend that slowly converges to the limit of the flat lizardite slab. Structural quantities such as bond distances and angles of nanotubes with increasing size asymptotically converge to the flat slab limit, with no discontinuities in the surrounding of the minimum energy structures. However, analysis of the elongation of a rectangular pseudo-unit cell along the nanotube circumference indicates that the main factor that leads lizardite to curl in tubes is the elastic strain caused by the mismatch between the lattice parameters of the two adjacent tetrahedral and octahedral sheets. It is also shown in this study that the curvature of the layers in one of the lately proposed models of antigorite, the \"wavy-layered\" polymorph of chrysotile, falls within the range of radii of minimum energy for the nanotubes. These findings provide quantitative insights into the peculiar polymorphism of these three phyllosilicates. They show also that chrysotile belongs to those families of inorganic nanotubes that present a minimum in their strain energy profile at a specific range of radii, which is lower in energy with respect to their flat equivalent.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Reciprocity has seen much less attention by Aegean archaeologists than other economic concepts such as redistribution, largely because of an assumption that reciprocity is characteristic of 'egalitarian' or less developed societies, as well as a related interest in political economies of more complex (palatial) societies, which are assumed to be characterized by redistribution. In Aegean archaeology, consideration of reciprocity is usually limited to gift exchange, either royal in the context of Late Bronze Age interactions with other societies in the eastern Mediterranean, or among elites in a Homeric model. Yet reciprocity has great potential to help us understand better the political economies and social organization of the Late Bronze Age Aegean. Reciprocity encompasses the social dynamics of any exchange between individuals and how these social relationships form the structure of social organization. Of particular interest here is how the standard categories of reciprocity-that is generalized (gift exchange), balanced (trade or immediate discharge of debt), and negative (one-sided benefit)-are manipulated through strategies such as competitive generosity and asymmetrical exchanges, leading to indebtedness of one exchange partner to the other; this can be institutionalized into hierarchical social structures. Feasting is one important category of exchange that can result in asymmetrical relationships and social inequality, and the Mycenaean evidence allows us to examine feasting in detail. Recent work in Linear B texts has suggested that palatial elites manipulated reciprocity through feasting as a strategy for maintaining social and political power. Likewise, elites utilized gifts of prestige items within their own polities to forge alliances and maintain social power.",

Lindbeck sought to incorporate insights from the linguistic turn in modern thought. However, it has faced criticisms ranging from sectarianism to concern with its overly static and homogeneous conceptions of \"narrative\" and \"Christian community\" that fail to recognize the church's participation in many overlapping communities of discourse. In this essay, I explore such criticisms and their recognition of the varied narratives and discursive practices by which Christian communities are formed, in ways both recognized and unrecognized. I then examine the work of Ugandan Catholic theologian Emmanuel Katongole which gives due attention to \"narrative\" and ideology, and in doing so, demonstrates \"postliberal\" theology's insights while also compensating for its weaknesses.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In nuclear facilities utilizing plutonium, polymeric materials are subjected to long-term, close-contact, and continuous alpha radiation exposure, which can lead to compounding material degradation and eventual failure. Herein we model the attenuation of a particles by linear-low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin films, and C-60 using Monte Carlo N-Particle Extended (MCNPX) software. The degradation of these materials was investigated experimentally by irradiating them with a beam of alpha particles of 5.8 MeV energy at a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator delivering a dose rate of 2.95 x 10(6) rad s(-1) over a 7.1 mm(2) sample area. Our development of a method to test alpha particle-induced material degradation using a tandem accelerator is significant as degradation from naturally occurring alpha sources (i.e. Pu, Am) occurs too slowly for these sources to be used in practical experiments. Our results show that PVA nanocomposites containing 5 wt% C-60 were found to withstand about 7 times the alpha dose of undoped PVA films before a puncture in the film was detected. When these films were adhered to a LLDPE sheet the dual layer polymer was capable of withstanding about 13 times the dose of LLDPE and nearly twice the dose of the doped PVA thin film alone. Doping polymers with C-60 is an attractive way to generate more durable, radiation tolerant materials without increasing the thickness of the material which would lead to greater waste for disposal. Thus, the results herein help to resolve a prevalent technical challenge faced in nuclear facilities that utilize polymeric materials for nuclear processing and disposal.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The \"Risk Society\" as Ulrich Beck (Beck, Ulrich. 1992. Risk society: Towards a new modernity. London, UK: Sage, Beck, Ulrich. 1999. World risk society. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press) has called modern society, has changed the policy dynamics of many highrisk policies. Policy conflicts occur due to both physically objective risks and socially constructed risks. Risk politicization means that issue expansion and attention cycles are likely to be related to the social construction of policy images. An interesting case in point concerns the risk perception about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) among four groups of people in South Korea: bureaucrats, citizens, scientists, and interest groups. We develop expectations about how the four groups will frame the political issues based on their roles and concerns in the policy process. Downs' (Downs, Anthony. 1972. Up and down with ecology: The issueattention cycle. Public Interest 28: 3850) work on the issueattention cycle suggests how issues rise and fall on the public agenda, and our work also directly tests his theses. This study uses semantic network analysis based on content analysis of key words in 6 400 articles published in 2008 to construct semantic networks for the four stakeholder groups over four stages in the policy process. Through this unique data analysis, we can see the major issue concerns and intensity of each of the four groups in the four policy stages by assessing the key words each group uses in the media articles and the visualizations of their semantic associations. We do find distinct differences in what issues each of the four groups focus on and how the focus of substance changes in each of the four policy stages that clarify how these groups framed the BSE policy issues. Our results both confirm and raise doubts about some predictions from the issueattention cycle. Citizens' attention follows closely to Downs' predictions, whereas the other stakeholders' issueattention cycles do not follow Downs' predictions as well. Finally, our study explains and demonstrates the value of semantic network analysis as a powerful method for understanding issue framing in the policy process.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Administrative structure can shape bureaucratic process, performance, and responsiveness and is a particularly important consideration when new bureaucratic functions and programs are being established. However, the factors that influence the assignment of these functions to specific government agencies or departments are understudied, particularly at the local level. The absence of empirical evidence regarding bureaucratic assignment in local government limits understanding of institutional design and the organizational choices available, particularly as they relate to specific policy areas. As an initial step in developing a theory of agency assignment at the local level, we examine the placement of sustainability programs in 401 US cities and assess explanations for assignment based on policy scope, interest group support, governmental capacity, policy characteristics, and institutional structures that shape the incentives of local decision makers. Although it is not a traditional function of local government, sustainability is becoming an increasingly common objective. Because of its newness and cross-cutting nature, local policy makers have an array of institutional units to which they can assign the primary responsibility for sustainability. We focus on two dimensions of assignment of bureaucratic responsibility: whether the locus of responsibility lies within the executive or a line department and whether there is a specialized unit within the city government that is explicitly responsible for sustainability. The scope and maturity of cities' sustainability policies and the structure of local representation (i.e., whether council representatives are elected by district, at-large, or via a mixed system) have the greatest influence on shaping administrative placement. The latter suggests potential distributive outcomes from local sustainability efforts.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Customer product returns are key cost drivers that eat into online retailers' profits. However, management research has neglected to examine ways of reducing return rates without causing a concomitant decrease in sales. Drawing from signalling and dissonance theories, we investigate the relationship between online retailers' reputation and product return rates. Two experiments designed to produce causal conclusions show that reputation reduces return rates (Studies 1 and 2) and that return motivation is a boundary condition for that relationship (Study 2). A field study based on an online consumer panel demonstrates the robustness of the negative impact of online retailer reputation on product returns in a setting that emphasizes external validity (Study 3), in comparison with Studies 1 and 2, which maximize internal validity. Study 3 also examines managerially important contingencies of the causal relationship by considering three variables: purchase frequency; retailer type; and customer gender. Overall findings indicate that an online retailer's reputation is a powerful means of reducing product return rates. The findings also show that the strength of the relationship between reputation and product returns is influenced by return motivation and the three variables investigated in the field study.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Polymers of various architectures with zwitterionic functionality have recently been shown to effectively suppress nonspecific fouling of surfaces by proteins and prokaryotic (bacteria) or eukaryotic (mammalian) cells as well as other microorganisms and environmental contaminants. In this work, zwitterionic copolymers were used to make thin coatings on substrates with the layer-by-layer method. Polyelectrolyte multilayers, PEMUs, were built with [poly(allylamine hydrochloride)], PAH, and copolymers of acrylic acid and either the AEDAPS zwitterionic group 3-[2-(acrylamido)-ethyldimethyl ammonio] propane sulfonate (PAA-co-AEDAPS), or benzophenone (PAABp). Benzophenone allowed the PEMU to be toughened by photocrosslinking post-deposition. The attachment of two mammalian cell lines, rat aortic smooth muscle (A7r5) and mouse fibroblasts (3T3), and the biofilm-forming Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli was studied on PEMUs terminated with PAA-co-AEDAPS. Consistent with earlier studies, it is shown that PAH/PAA-co-AEDAPS PEMUs resist the adhesion of mammalian cells, but, contrary to our initial hypothesis, are bacterial adhesive and significantly so after maximizing the surface presentation of PAA-co-AEDAPS. This unexpected contrast in the adhesive behavior of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is explained by differences in adhesion mechanisms as well as different responses to the topology and morphology of the multilayer surface.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The solid-state synthesis and structural characterisation of perovskite BaSn(1-x)ScxO(3-delta)(x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) and its corresponding hydrated ceramics are reported. Powder and neutron X-ray diffractions reveal the presence of cubic perovskites (space group Pm (3) over barm) with an increasing cell parameter as a function of scandium concentration along with some indication of phase segregation. Sn-119 and Sc-45 solid-state NMR spectroscopy data highlight the existence of oxygen vacancies in the dry materials, and their filling upon hydrothermal treatment with D2O. It also indicates that the Sn4+ and Sc3+ local distribution at the B-site of the perovskite is inhomogeneous and suggests that the oxygen vacancies are located in the scandium dopant coordination shell at low concentrations (x <= 0.2) and in the tin coordination shell at high concentrations (x >= 0.3). O-17 NMR spectra on O-17 enriched BaSn1-xScxO3-delta materials show the existence of Sn-O-Sn, Sn-O-Sc and Sc-O-Sc bridging oxygen environments. A further room temperature neutron powder diffraction study on deuterated BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3-delta refines the deuteron position at the 24k crystallographic site (x, y, 0) with x = 0.579(3) and y = 0.217(3) which leads to an O-D bond distance of 0.96(1) angstrom and suggests tilting of the proton towards the next nearest oxygen. Proton conduction was found to dominate in wet argon below 700 degrees C with total conductivity values in the range 1.8 x 10(-4) to 1.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) between 300 and 600 degrees C. Electron holes govern the conduction process in dry oxidizing conditions, whilst in wet oxygen they compete with protonic defects leading to a wide mixed conduction region in the 200 to 600 degrees C temperature region, and a suppression of the conductivity at higher temperature.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This article examines the development of the aspect of health in late Neoplatonic ontology as originated in Proclus and illustrated in Marinus' Life of Proclus and Damascius' Life of Isidore. In light of the steadily growing Neoplatonic interest in the philosophic value of the body and the widely spreading presence of the new and only Savior, Proclus looks closer at the Demiurge's cosmological activity in the universe to discern its health-instituting nature based upon which he builds a health register distinguishing between Demiurgic and Asclepian health. The former maintains the orderly balance in the universe; the latter restores the individual's health. Between the two kinds of health extends a healing ontological \"chain\" unfolding from the Demiurge through Apollo, Asclepius, and the healing heroes, ending in certain individual souls, which are endowed with special healing powers, i.e., Asclepian souls. Two examples of such souls are Proclus himself, as portrayed in his biography by Marinus, and one Iacobus Psychristus, as documented in Damascius' Life of Isidore. The fact that one is a philosopher and the other is a physician captures the symbiotic relation of philosophy and medicine in late antiquity.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Postmenopausal osteoporosis may be caused, in part, by oxidative stress and inflammation. Vitamin E is a strong antioxidant which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and bone-protective effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of various doses of supplemental vitamin E on osteoclastogenesis in ovariectomized rats. Sixty 12-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were sham-operated (Sham) or ovariectomized (Ovx; 4 groups) and fed a diet containing basal levels of vitamin E (75 mg D-a tocopherol acetate per kg diet) for 220 days. Rats in three of the Ovx groups were given supplemental doses of vitamin E (300, 525, and 750 mg D-a tocopherol acetate per kg diet) for the last 100 days. Femoral bone marrow cells were isolated, cultured, and osteoclasts were counted and normalized to 1000 total bone marrow cells. Blood monocyte and lymphocyte counts were also determined. Osteoclast number was significantly higher in the Ovx control group and was suppressed by all three doses of vitamin E, although more effectively in the Ovx group that received 300 mg per kg diet vitamin E. Additionally, vitamin E suppressed the Ovx-induced increase in monocyte and lymphocyte production. The results of this study suggest that vitamin E supplementation suppresses osteoclastogenesis, possibly by inhibiting monocyte and lymphocyte production.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The ability to detect picomolar concentrations of glucagon and amylin using fluorescently labeled mirror-image aptamers, so-called Spiegelmers, is demonstrated. Spiegelmers rival the specificity of antibodies and overcome the problem of biostability of natural aptamers in a biological matrix. Using Spiegelmers as affinity probes, noncompetitive capillary electrophoresis affinity assays of glucagon and murine amylin were developed and optimized. The detection limit for glucagon was 6 pM and for amylin was 40 pM. Glucagon-like peptide-1 and -2 did not interfere with the glucagon assay, while the amylin assay showed cross-reactivity to calcitonin gene related peptide. The developed assays were combined with a competitive immunoassay for insulin to measure glucagon, amylin, and insulin secretion from batches of islets after incubation with different glucose concentrations. The development of these assays is an important step towards incorporation into an online measurement system for monitoring dynamic secretion from single islets.",

      "Abstract Note" : "A beneficial \"microenvironment effect\" on the efficiency of confined electrocatalysts is predicted by theory. However, examples of its experimental confirmation are scarce for catalysts based on polyoxometalates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For this purpose, the cyclic 48-tungsto-8-phosphate [H7P8W48O184](33) (P8W48) was fixed in a 3D configuration on reduced graphene oxide sheets (rGO) to boost its HER activity. The HRTEM imaging and the solid state P-31 NMR spectrum of P8W48/rGO reveal a strong interaction between individual P8W48 and transparent rGO sheets. The calculation of the interaction between P8W48 and graphene (G) sheets is difficult to perform within a reasonable period of time because of the large size and very high overall negative charge of P8W48. However, as P8W48 is symmetrical, a quarter of its structure [H2P2W12O48](12-) (P2W12) was extracted as a DFT calculation model. As P8W48 in P8W48/rGO is neutral, due to surrounding counter cations, the calculation model P2W12 is neutral with protons considering the affordable computational time. The adsorption energy for P2W12 on G (-1.55 eV) and the charge transfer between P2W12 and G (0.66 vertical bar e vertical bar) indicate that a strong interaction between P2W12 and G sheets exists. Kinetic studies show that the P8W48/rGO hybrids display excellent HER activity in acid, further confirmed by reproducible generation of hydrogen with quantitative faradaic yield and a high turnover frequency (11 s(-1) at 295 mV overpotential) for a noble metal-free electrocatalyst. Importantly, the overpotentials required for the HER compare well with those of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt), which indicates that P8W48/rGO is a promising cheap HER electrocatalyst. We demonstrate here the most convincing experimental evidence of the \"microenvironment effect\" on HER electrocatalysis by a polyoxometalate.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In the last decade, specific attention has been paid to total mercury (HgT) stable isotopic composition, especially in natural samples such as aquatic organisms, due to its potential to track the cycle of this toxic element in the environment. Here, we investigated Hg Compound Specific stable Isotopic Composition (CSIC) of natural inorganic Hg (iHg) and methylmercury (MMHg) in various tissues of aquatic mammals (Beluga whale from the Arctic marine environment and seals from the freshwater lake Baikal, Russia). In seals' organs the variation in mass dependent fractionation (MDF, delta Hg-202) for total Hg was significantly correlated to the respective fraction of iHg and MMHg compounds, with MMHg being enriched by B3% in heavier isotopes relative to iHg. On the other hand, we observe insignificant variation in Hg mass independent isotope fractionation (MIF, Delta Hg-199) among iHg and MMHg in all organs for the same mammal species and MMHg in prey items. MIF signatures suggest that both MMHg and iHg in aquatic mammals have the same origin (i.e., MMHg from food), and are representative of Hg photochemistry in the water column of the mammal ecosystem. MDF signatures of Hg compounds indicate that MMHg is demethylated in vivo before being stored in the muscle, and the iHg formed is stored in the liver, and to a lesser extent in the kidney, before excretion. Thus, Hg CSIC analysis in mammals can be a powerful tool for tracing the metabolic response to Hg exposure.",

      "Abstract Note" : "1. Speed regulations of watercraft in protected areas are designed to reduce lethal collisions with wildlife but can have economic consequences. We present a quantitative framework for investigating the risk of deadly collisions between boats and wildlife. 2. We apply encounter rate theory to demonstrate how marine mammal-boat encounter rate can be used to predict the expected number of deaths associated with management scenarios. We illustrate our approach with management scenarios for two endangered species: the Florida manatee Trichechus manatus latirostris and the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis. We used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to demonstrate the uncertainty that is associated with our estimate of relative mortality. 3. We show that encounter rate increased with vessel speed but that the expected number of encounters varies depending on the boating activities considered. For instance, in a scenario involving manatees and boating activities such as water skiing, the expected number of encounters in a given area (in a fixed time interval) increased with vessel speed. In another scenario in which a vessel made a transit of fixed length, the expected number of encounters decreases slightly with boat speed. In both cases, the expected number of encounters increased with distanced travelled by the boat. For whales, we found a slight reduction ((similar to)0.1%) in the number of encounters under a scenario where speed is unregulated; this reduction, however, is negligible, and overall expected relative mortality was (similar to)30% lower under the scenario with speed regulation. The probability of avoidance by the animal or vessel was set to 0 because of lack of data, but we explored the importance of this parameter on the model predictions. In fact, expected relative mortality under speed regulations decreases even further when the probability of avoidance is a decreasing function of vessel speed. 4. By applying encounter rate theory to the case of boat collisions with marine mammals, we gained new insights about encounter processes between wildlife and watercraft. Our work emphasizes the importance of considering uncertainty when estimating wildlife mortality. Finally, our findings are relevant to other systems and ecological processes involving the encounter between moving agents.",

This finding is of particular concern as women typically live longer than men do, and thus, rely on accumulated savings for longer periods of time. This study extends work in the psychology of investing by examining the relationship between gender and investment risk and the role financial self-efficacy (FSE) plays. Data collected from 182 US student subjects tested the hypotheses that women make less risky investments than men do and that FSE is positively related to the level of risk taken within investment portfolios. The results not only supported the hypotheses but also the analysis shows that FSE might account for the frequently observed gender difference associated with greater financial risk taking.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We present and verify a new method to measure vanadium isotope ratios using a Thermo Scientific Neptune multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) operated in medium mass resolution mode. We collect masses 48 through 53 simultaneously using the L2, L1, Center, H1, H2 and H3 collectors. The Center cup is equipped with a 10(12) Omega resistor, H1 is equipped with a 10(10) Omega resistor, while the rest of the collectors have standard 10(11) Omega resistors. Unlike previous low-resolution methods, the use of medium mass resolution (Delta M/M similar to 4000) permits separation of V, Ti and Cr isotopes from all interfering molecular species representing combinations of C, N, O, S, Cl, and Ar. We show that the external reproducibility follows a power law function with respect to the number of V+ ions collected and achieve an external reproducibility of +/-0.15 parts per thousand with total V+ ion beam intensities of similar to 1 nA. The separation of interfering molecular species from the V mass spectrum reduces the V requirement for precise isotope data to as little as 200-300 ng V per analysis-a reduction of similar to 90% compared with previous methods-making several low-V matrices amenable to V isotope analysis.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have emerged as an important cell type in cell therapy and tissue engineering. In these applications, maintaining the therapeutic properties of hMSCs requires tight control of the culture environments and the structural cell organizations. Bioreactor systems are essential tools to achieve these goals in the clinical-scale expansion and tissue engineering applications. This review summarizes how different bioreactors provide cues to regulate the structure and the chemico-mechanical microenvironment of hMSCs with a focus on 3D organization. In addition to conventional bioreactors, recent advances in microfluidic bioreactors as a novel approach to better control the hMSC microenvironment are also discussed. These advancements highlight the key role of bioreactor systems in preserving hMSC's functional properties by providing dynamic and temporal regulation of in vitro cellular microenvironment.",

To this end, we have constructed a new blue colored pillared-paddlewheel (PPW) MOF, namely BMOF composed of redox-active N,N'-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,6-dipyrrolidyl naphthalenediimide (BPDPNDI) pillars and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis-(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene (TCPB) struts, and grown stable, uniform BMOF films on ZnO substrates via a bottom-up method for device integration and testing. The electrical conductivity (sigma) of BMOF films is ca. 6 x 10(-5) S m(-1) (25 degrees C), which surges up to 2.3 x 10(-3) S m(-1) upon infiltration of pi-acidic methyl viologen (MV2+) guests, but remains unaffected by large C-60 molecules that are size excluded. These results demonstrate for the first time that the conductivity of MOFs can be fine-tuned by complementary guest pi-systems that can promote long-range electron delocalization by forming extended pi-stacks with the redox-active ligands.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Salt bridges are essential to protein stability and dynamics. Despite the importance, there has been scarce of detailed discussion on how salt bridge partners interact with each other in distinct solvent exposed environments. In this study, employing a recent generalized orthogonal space tempering (gOST) method, we enabled efficient molecular dynamics simulation of repetitive breaking and reforming of salt bridge structures within a minimalist salt-bridge model, the Asp-Arg dipeptide and thereby were able to map its detailed free energy landscape in aqueous solution. Free energy surface analysis shows that although individually-solvated states are more favorable, salt-bridge states still occupy a noticeable portion of the overall population. Notably, the competing forces, e.g. intercharge attractions that drive the formation of salt bridges and solvation forces that pull the charged groups away from each other, are energetically comparable. As the result, the salt bridge stability is highly tunable by local environments; for instance when local water molecules are perturbed to interact more strongly with each other, the population of the salt-bridge states is likely to increase. Our results reveal the critical role of local solvent structures in modulating salt-bridge partner interactions and imply the importance of water fluctuations on conformational dynamics that involves solvent accessible salt bridge formations.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Noncovalent interactions between halide anions and a series of N-(4-vinyl-2-benzoic acid benzyl ester)-phenyl-urea containing receptors (1-8) based on hydrogen bond and (or) anion-pi interactions were investigated via theoretical calculations based on dispersion corrected density functional B3LYP-D3. Particularly, the fluorine substitution effects were deeply explored. The results showed that the substituent number and position of fluorine groups on the phenyl ring of the benzoic acid esters group has a significant effect on the configuration and cooperative properties of the hydrogen bond and anion-pi interactions. Consequently, a more feasible and rational geometric criterion for either a strong or weak halide-anion-pi contact was proposed via three inequalities independent of any empirical parameters, which is different from the criterion proposed very recently by Albrecht and Rissanen based on their experience with solid state anion-pi interactions (Chem. Sci., 2015, 6, 354-359). Additionally, electronic properties and behavior of the systems were discussed according to the calculations on the frontier molecular orbital, total electrostatic potential and visualized weak interactions regions. It is expected that the theoretical explorations from a molecular level in this work may be useful for future experimental study and helpful for understanding the structure-activity relationship between aromatic rings and anion-pi interactions in the case of combination of distinct noncovalent interactions.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Research summary: This article uses item response theory (IRT) to advance strategic management research, focusing on an application to corporate social responsibility (CSR). IRT explicitly models firms' and individuals' observable actions in order to measure unobserved, latent characteristics. IRT models have helped researchers improve measures in numerous disciplines. To demonstrate their potential in strategic management, we show how the method improves on a key measure of corporate social responsibility and corporate social performance (CSP), the KLD Index, by creating what we term D-SOCIAL-KLD scores, and associated estimates of their accuracy, from the underlying data. We show, for instance, that firms such as Apple may not be as good as previously thought, while firms such as Walmart may perform better than typically believed. We also show that the D-SOCIAL-KLD measure outperforms the KLD Index and factor analysis in predicting new CSR-related activity.Managerial summary: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) continues to grow in importance among the press, political activists, managers, analysts, and investors, yet measurement techniques have not kept up. We show that the most common approach for measuring CSRadding up observable traitsis fundamentally flawed, even if these traits accurately capture CSR-related behavior. We introduce an improved measurement technique that treats these traits as test questions that are differentially weighted, so that hard CSR activities affect a company's score more than easy CSR activities. This approach produces a measure that offers a more reliable comparison of firms than standard measures. Our approach has a number of additional advantages, including differentiating firms that receive identical scores on an additive scale and accounting for how CSR-related behavior has evolved over time. Anybody who cares about CSR should consider using our measure (available at ) as the basis for analyzing firms' CSR. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Optimization of colloidal nanoparticle synthesis techniques requires an understanding of underlying particle growth mechanisms. Nonclassical growth mechanisms are particularly important as they affect nanoparticle, size and shape distributions, which in turn influence functional properties. For example, preferential attachment of nanoparticles is known to lead to the formation of mesocrystals, although the formation mechanism is currently not well-understood: Here we employ in situ liquid cell scanning transmission electron microscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to demonstrate that the experimentally observed preference for end-to-end attachment, of silver nanorods is a result of weaker solvation forces occurring at rod ends. SMD reveals that when the side of a nanorod approaches another rod, perturbation in the surface-bound water, at the nanorod surface creates significant energy barriers to attachment. Additionally, rod morphology (i.e., facet shape) effects can explain the majority of the side attachment effects that are observed experimentally.",

      "Abstract Note" : "We demonstrate the photocatalytic protonation of a silylenol ether using 7-bromo-2-naphthol as an ESPT catalyst with phenol as the sacrificial proton source. Greater than 95% conversion is achieved with 1 mol% catalyst. The reaction cycle is dependent on the significantly increased acidity of the catalyst in the excited state as well as the long lifetime for the triplet excited state of 7-bromo-2-naphthol. The reaction does not occur in the absence of light (367 nm) and can readily be controlled by light intensity modulation. We also demonstrate that a 72% reaction yield can be obtained with unsubstituted naphthol as the catalyst by coupling triplet energy transfer, via a visible light absorbing (445 nm) sensitizer, into the catalytic cycle. These results open the door to an entirely new class of sensitized photocatalytic reactions that harness the excited state acidity of ESPT dyes.",

      "Abstract Note" : "There is a growing body of research linking children's positively biased self-perceptions with higher levels of aggression. This study extended this area of research by examining prospective associations of positively biased self-perceptions of peer acceptance with overt and relational aggression. In addition, moderating effects of peer rejection were examined to test the disputed overestimation hypothesis,\" which posits that the link between bias and aggression is limited to children who are rejected by their peers. Using a two-wave longitudinal design, measures of peer-rated and self-perceived peer acceptance and peer-rated overt and relational aggression were obtained for 712 children in 3rd through 5th grades (386 girls and 326 boys). Positively biased perceptions led to increases in relational, but not overt, aggression. This pattern was observed even when the effects of gender, race, peer rejection, and overt aggression on relational aggression were controlled. Contrary to the disputed overestimation hypothesis, the prospective associations between bias and aggression did not vary as a function of children's peer rejection status, thus supporting the view that positive bias predicts future aggressive behavior, regardless of social status. The results are discussed in terms of the comparability with previous findings and practical implications. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In aqueous solution, solute conformational transitions are governed by intimate interplays of the fluctuations of solute solute, solute water, and water water interactions. To promote molecular fluctuations to enhance sampling of essential conformational changes, a common strategy to construct an expanded Hamiltonian through a series of Hamiltonian perturbations and thereby broaden the distribution of certain interactions of focus. Due to a lack of active sampling of configuration response to Hamiltonian transitions, it is challenging for common expanded Hamiltonian methods to robustly explore solvent mediated rare conformational events. The orthogonal space sampling (OSS) scheme, as exemplified by the orthogonal space random walk and orthogonal space tempering methods, provides a general framework for synchronous acceleration of slow configuration responses. To more effectively sample conformational transitions in aqueous solution, in this work, we devised a generalized orthogonal space tempering (gOST) algorithm. Specifically, in the Hamiltonian perturbation part, a solvent-accessible-surface-area-dependent term is introduced to implicitly perturb near-solute water water fluctuations; more importantly in the orthogonal space response part, the generalized force order parameter is generalized as a two-dimension order parameter set, in which essential solute solvent and solute solute components are separately treated. The gOST algorithm is evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine (Ala(10)) peptide. On the basis of a fully automated sampling protocol, the gOST simulation enabled repetitive folding and unfolding of the solvated peptide within a single continuous trajectory and allowed for detailed constructions of Ala(10) folding/unfolding free energy surfaces. The gOST result reveals that solvent cooperative fluctuations play a pivotal role in Ala(10) folding/unfolding transitions. In addition, our assessment analysis suggests that because essential conformational events are mainly driven by the compensating fluctuations of essential solute solvent and solute-solute interactions, commonly employed \"predictive\" sampling methods are unlikely to be effective on this seemingly \"simple\" system. The gOST development presented in this paper illustrates how to employ the OSS scheme for physics-based sampling method designs.",

Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of the number of sessions attended, therapy duration, and number of no-shows and cancellations. However, adjusting for Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) at intake, patients receiving the financial incentives had significantly higher GAF rating at termination compared with those who did not receive the intervention. Conclusions: Financial incentives that reward therapy attendance and adherence with discounted fees is associated with improved clinical functioning. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "In many species with internal fertilization, molecules transferred in the male ejaculate trigger and interact with physiological changes in females. It is controversial to what extent these interactions between the sexes act synergistically to mediate the female switch to a reproductive state or instead reflect sexual antagonism evolved as a by product of sexual selection on males. To address this question, we eliminated sexual selection by enforcing monogamy in populations of Drosophila melanogaster for 65 generations and then measured the expression of male seminal fluid protein genes and genes involved in the female response to mating. In the absence of sperm competition, male and female reproductive interests are perfectly aligned and any antagonism should be reduced by natural selection. Consistent with this idea, males from monogamous populations showed reduced expression of seminal fluid protein genes, 16% less on average than in polygamous males. Further, we identified 428 genes that responded to mating in females. After mating, females with an evolutionary history of monogamy exhibited lower relative expression of genes that were up regulated in response to mating and higher expression of genes that were down-regulated - in other words, their post-mating transcriptome appeared more virgin-like. Surprisingly, these genes showed a similar pattern even before mating, suggesting that monogamous females evolved to be less poised for mating and the accompanying receipt of male seminal fluid proteins. This reduced investment by both monogamous males and females in molecules involved in post-copulatory interactions points to a pervasive role of sexual conflict in shaping these interactions.",

In charge neutral r-TLG, the orbital degeneracy is broken first, and the layer degeneracy is broken last and only in the presence of an interlayer potential U-perpendicular to.

      "Abstract Note" : "Transmissible tumors are those that have transcended the bounds of their incipient hosts by evolving the ability to infect another individual through direct transfer of cancer cells, thus becoming parasitic cancer clones. Coitus, biting, and scratching are transfer mechanisms for the two primary species studied, the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). Canine transmissible venereal tumors (CTVT) are likely thousands of years old, and have successfully travelled from host to host around the world, while the Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is much younger and geographically localized. The dog tumor is not necessarily lethal, while the devil tumor has driven the population to near extinction. Transmissible tumors are uniform in that they have complex immunologic profiles, which allow them to escape immune detection by their hosts, sometimes for long periods of time. In this review, we explore how transmissible tumors in CTVT, DFTD, and as well as the soft-shell clam and Syrian hamster, can advance studies of tumor biology.",

      "Abstract Note" : "This article examines recent rainfall conditions in two sectors of eastern Africa, the summer rainfall region and the equatorial rainfall region with rainy seasons in the boreal spring and boreal autumn. The analysis covers the years 1998-2014 and is carried out using TRMM 3B43 Version 7 rainfall estimates. In both regions, extensive periods of anomalously low rainfall and prolonged drought have prevailed since roughly 2008. Prior to that time, only three periods of drought are noteworthy 1998/1999, 2000, and 2005. The post-2008 drought conditions were interrupted by floods in both regions in February 2010 and in several years in the equatorial region. This rapid alternation between extremes creates additional hardships on the population. Two notable results emerge from this analysis. One is the tendency for similar trends in interannual variability in both regions, despite vastly different rainfall regimes. The other is the persistence of recent droughts through several rainy seasons. The implication of these results is that one or more factors in interannual variability is operative in all seasons. This could account for the common trends in the equatorial and summer rainfall regions.",

The model is written for dynamic and steady state operation and combines principles of classical thermodynamics and heat transfer, with the use of empirical and theoretical correlations for simplicity, in order to quickly assess the potential of new fuel mixtures such as microalgae-derived biodiesel and biogas to feed the compression ignition internal combustion engines. Geometric and operating parameters (e.g., rpm, piston and cylinder diameter, stroke, engine operating temperature, engine compression ratio, and air-to-fuel ratio) are the basis for the model equations, which are capable of calculating the engine mean indicated pressure, indicated power, and indicated torque with respect to crank speed. Friction losses are quantified based on existing empirical correlations for engines with direct fuel injection, so that engine net power and torque are also assessed. The model was adjusted and experimentally validated by direct comparison of the obtained results to previously published experimental data, and engine nominal curves. The simulations show the following: (i) using only biodiesel, the engine power reduces about 1.0%, and the fuel consumption rises about 12.0% with respect to fossil diesel; (ii) using only natural gas, the engine power reduces about 2.0%, and the fuel consumption reduces about 13.0% with respect to fossil diesel; and (iii) fuel mixtures using 50% of biodiesel and/or 50.0% of natural gas produce power values within 1.0% when compared to each other. The obtained numerical results demonstrate that the model is expected to be an important and simple tool for design, control, and optimization of compression ignition engines driven by diesel, biodiesel, and biogas fuel mixtures, due to the combination of accuracy with low computational time.

      "Abstract Note" : "More than a quarter century after the discovery of the high-temperature superconductor (HTS) YBa2Cu3O6+delta (YBCO; ref. 1), studies continue to uncover complexity in its phase diagram. In addition to HTS and the pseudogap(2,3), there is growing evidence for multiple phases with boundaries which are functions of temperature (T), doping (p) and magnetic field(4-8). Here we report the low-temperature electronic specific heat (C-elec) of YBa2Cu3O6.43 and YBa2Cu3O6.47 (p = 0.076 and 0.084) up to a magnetic field (H) of 34.5 T, a poorly understood region of the underdoped H-T-p phase space. We observe two regimes in the low-temperature limit: below a characteristic magnetic field H' approximate to 12-15 T, C-elec/T obeys an expected H-1/2 behaviour(9,10); however, near H' there is a sharp inflection followed by a linear-in-H behaviour. H' rests deep within the superconducting phase and, thus, the linear-in-H behaviour is observed in the zero-resistance regime(11). In the limit of zero temperature, C-elec/T is proportional to the zero-energy electronic density of states. At one of our dopings, the inflection is sharp only at lowest temperatures, and we thus conclude that this inflection is evidence of a magnetic-field-driven quantum phase transition.",

      "Abstract Note" : "The Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) states that an individual is dead when all functions of the entire brain have ceased irreversibly. However, it has been questioned whether some functions of the hypothalamus, particularly osmoregulation, can continue after the clinical diagnosis of brain death (BD). In order to learn whether parts of the hypothalamus can continue to function after the diagnosis of BD, we performed 2 separate systematic searches of the MEDLINE database, corresponding to the functions of the posterior and anterior pituitary. No meta-analysis is possible due to nonuniformity in the clinical literature. However, some modest generalizations can reasonably be drawn from a narrative review and from anatomic considerations that explain why these findings should be expected. We found evidence suggesting the preservation of hypothalamic function, including secretion of hypophysiotropic hormones, responsiveness to anterior pituitary stimulation, and osmoregulation, in a substantial proportion of patients declared dead by neurological criteria. We discuss several possible explanations for these findings. We conclude by suggesting that additional clinical research with strict inclusion criteria is necessary and further that a more nuanced and forthright public dialogue is needed, particularly since standard diagnostic practices and the UDDA may not be entirely in accord.",

In the complete draw down two-stage raffle, the first stage tickets are eliminated from the active pool of tickets, while in the no draw down raffle they remain in the active pool. We find that both two-stage raffles initially perform better than the standard one-stage 50-50 raffle. Over time, the aggregate contribution level in the complete draw down raffle declines and approaches that of the one-stage raffle, while in the no draw down raffle contributions are stable and remain higher than those in the other two mechanisms. In both two-stage raffles, we observe a positive correlation between the proceeds of the first stage and the number of tickets bought in the second stage. Our results are at odds with a standard warm glow model of giving, and also cannot be explained by the joy of winning or learning about bidders' types. (JEL C72, C92, D64)",

      "Abstract Note" : "The gustatory cortex (GC) is widely regarded for its integral role in the acquisition and retention of conditioned taste aversions (CTAs) in rodents, but large lesions in this area do not always result in CTA impairment. Recently, using a new lesion mapping system, we found that severe CTA expression deficits were associated with damage to a critical zone that included the posterior half of GC in addition to the insular cortex (IC) that is just dorsal and caudal to this region (visceral cortex). Lesions in anterior GC were without effect. Here, neurotoxic bilateral lesions were placed in the anterior half of this critical damage zone, at the confluence of the posterior GC and the anterior visceral cortex (termed IC2), the posterior half of this critical damage zone that contains just VC (termed IC3), or both of these subregions (IC2 + IC3). Then, pre- and postsurgically acquired CTAs (to 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 M sucrose, respectively) were assessed postsurgically in 15-minute one-bottle and 96-hour two-bottle tests. Li-injected rats with histologically confirmed bilateral lesions in IC2 exhibited the most severe CTA deficits, whereas those with bilateral lesions in IC3 were relatively normal, exhibiting transient disruptions in the one-bottle sessions. Groupwise lesion maps showed that CTA-impaired rats had more extensive damage to IC2 than did unimpaired rats. Some individual differences in CTA expression among rats with similar lesion profiles were observed, suggesting idiosyncrasies in the topographic representation of information in the IC. Nevertheless, this study implicates IC2 as the critical zone of the IC for normal CTA expression. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

      "Abstract Note" : "Retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ) and Muller glia-derived progenitors have been well described for the eyes of fish, amphibians, and birds. However, there is no information regarding a CMZ and the nature of retinal glia in species phylogenetically bridging amphibians and birds. The purpose of this study was to examine the retinal glia and investigate whether a CMZ is present in the eyes of reptilian species. We used immunohistochemical analyses to study retinal glia, neurons that could influence CMZ progenitors, the retinal margin, and the nonpigmented epithelium of ciliary body of garter snakes, queen snakes, anole lizards, snapping turtles, and painted turtles. We compare our observations on reptile eyes to the CMZ and glia of fish, amphibians, and birds. In all species, Sox9, Pax6, and the glucocorticoid receptor are expressed by Muller glia and cells at the retinal margin. However, proliferating cells were found only in the CMZ of turtles and not in the eyes of anoles and snakes. Similar to eyes of chickens, the retinal margin in turtles contains accumulations of GLP1/glucagonergic neurites. We find that filamentous proteins, vimentin and GFAP, are expressed by Muller glia, but have different patterns of subcellular localization in the different species of reptiles. We provide evidence that the reptile retina may contain nonastrocytic inner retinal glial cells, similar to those described in the avian retina. We conclude that the retinal glia, glucagonergic neurons, and CMZ of turtles appear to be most similar to those of fish, amphibians, and birds 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Two hundred and four women aged 18-65 (mean 25.6 years, SD 9.13) with full or subclinical BN were recruited in five US Midwestern communities and specialized eating disorder clinics. Participants completed questionnaires including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and self-reported whether they had ever had a lifetime suicide attempt. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict lifetime suicide attempts from each subscale of the CTQ. Childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse were significantly associated with the presence of a lifetime suicide attempt in women with BN. Childhood emotional and physical neglect were not associated with suicide attempts. Individuals with BN who have experienced childhood emotional and sexual abuse are at increased risk of a lifetime suicide attempt. Future research is needed to understand the mechanism to address in treatment and prevention efforts. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential increased risk of suicide in individuals with BN with a history of childhood abuse.",

      "Abstract Note" : "To examine differences in hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations between Caucasian and African American (AA) postmenopausal women, as well as the effects of dietary calcium, protein and vitamin D intakes on 25(OH)D, PTH, and body adiposity using structural equation modeling (SEM). Population-based prospective cohort study. Academic research using the baseline data from two longitudinal studies. Included n=113 Caucasian and n=40 African American, postmenopausal women who completed the baseline data collection and met inclusion criteria (dietary calcium intake < 900 mg/day and being generally healthy) between 2006 and 2010. Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, assessed by dietary records, were examined in relation to calcitropic hormones concentrations and adiposity markers. Independent t-tests, confirmatory factor analysis, SEM and multi-group analyses were conducted to examine the aforementioned relationships as well as group differences among hormones, dietary intake, anthropometrics, age and other factors. Dietary calcium and protein intakes were significantly lower in AA women. Years since menopause were significantly higher in AA compared to Caucasian women. PTH and 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in AA compared to Caucasian women. Dietary calcium and protein intakes did not influence body adiposity in either group of women. Dietary vitamin D had minimal indirect (via 25(OH)D levels) influence on adiposity. The study confirmed the positive relationship of 25(OH)D with adiposity markers and both AA and Caucasian women. The study provides a unique example of the use of SEM in nutrition research within a clinical context. This model should be further tested in other populations.",
